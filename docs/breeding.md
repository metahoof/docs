# Breeding System & Genetics in MetaHoof <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

> Building Champions Through Strategy & Bloodline Mastery

## 1️⃣ Introduction to Breeding in MetaHoof

Breeding is one of the **most strategic and rewarding mechanics** in MetaHoof, allowing players to create **new
generations of racehorses** with inherited traits, unique bloodlines, and competitive advantages.

By carefully selecting parent horses, managing breed licenses, and understanding genetic probabilities, players can *
*optimize their stable for long-term success**—whether by producing elite racers, valuable marketplace assets, or
specialized breeding bloodlines.

Breeding in MetaHoof is not just about **creating more horses**—it's about **building a legacy of champions**.

## 2️⃣ How the Breeding System Works

Breeding in MetaHoof requires **two parent horses** and a **Breed License Uniq**, ensuring that every foal is **a
carefully planned genetic investment**.

### 🔹 Breeding Steps:

1. **Select Parent Horses** – Choose two compatible horses from your stable or the breeding marketplace.
2. **Use a Breed License** – Apply a **Breed License Uniq**, which defines breeding conditions such as **class,
   bloodline restrictions, and season availability**.
3. **Genetic Calculation & Trait Inheritance** – The foal’s **stats, traits, and class potential** are determined by a **genetic algorithm based on both parents**.
4. **Foal Minting** – The new horse is **minted as a unique NFT**, complete with its own **bloodline, attributes, and
   racing potential**.
5. **Growth & Development** – Newly bred foals **start untrained** and must be **raised, trained, and raced** to develop
   their full potential.

Breeding is not just about **luck**—it’s about **strategy, planning, and understanding the genetic probabilities of
inheritance**.

## 3️⃣ Bloodlines & Breed Types

MetaHoof's breeding system is designed to **preserve rarity, maintain competitive balance, and introduce real strategic depth** when selecting breeding pairs. The combination of **bloodlines and breed types** determines a horse’s **genetic stability, breeding potential, and overall value**.

---

### 🏇 Bloodline Hierarchy

MetaHoof features **four distinct bloodlines**, each carrying **unique attributes and racing specializations**. A horse’s **bloodline is always inherited from the Mare**, meaning strategic pairing is key when planning breeding outcomes.

🏇 **Mirage Arabians** → **Agile & Refined**

---

## 4️⃣ Breed Types & Their Impact

Breed Type determines **how a horse interacts with the breeding system**, affecting **foal quality, genetic predictability, and rarity**. While **bloodline comes from the Mare, breed type is determined by both parents** and influences **inheritance, longevity, and resale value**.

### 🔹 Breed Type Categories

✅ **Purebred** → Horses from a **single, uninterrupted lineage**, offering **high genetic stability and specialized traits**.  
✅ **Crossbreed** → Horses bred from **mixed lineages**, leading to **hybrid adaptability and diverse but unpredictable traits**.  
✅ **Legendary Breed** → Exceptionally rare horses, **possible through specific breeding rules**, retaining **exclusive genetic advantages**.

---

### 📌 Key Advantages & Trade-offs

- **Purebreds** provide **genetic consistency**, making them reliable for **specific race strategies and breeding programs**.
- **Crossbreeds** inherit a **wider range of strengths**, offering **greater adaptability but less predictability** in breeding outcomes.
- **Legendary Breeds** are **exceptionally scarce**, ensuring:
   - **Guaranteed minimum quality for offspring** in breeding.
   - **Longer racing and breeding longevity** due to superior genetics.
   - **Unique and rare visual traits**, including **exclusive coat patterns, mane colors, and inscriptions**.

Legendary breeds stand at the top of the **breeding hierarchy**, combining **rarity, genetic superiority, and high market value**, making them a coveted asset in MetaHoof’s ecosystem.

## 5️⃣ Trait Inheritance & Genetic Mechanics

Each foal in MetaHoof **inherits a unique combination of traits from both parents**, meaning careful **breeding
selection can refine a horse’s strengths over generations**.

### 📊 Inherited Traits

When breeding, a foal inherits a **combination of traits** from both parents, with some attributes influenced by **dominant-recessive probabilities**. This means **genetic advantages can carry over or evolve across multiple generations**.

#### **Core Inherited Traits:**
1. **Speed** – Determines **acceleration and peak velocity**.
2. **Stamina** – Affects **endurance over long distances**.
3. **Agility** – Governs how well the horse **handles turns and obstacles**.
4. **Temperament** – Influences **race strategy effectiveness**.
5. **Hidden Genetic Traits** – Occasionally, foals **inherit rare or mutated abilities**, adding an **element of surprise and uniqueness** to bloodline progression.

---

### 🧬 **Bloodline & Trait Inheritance**

- A foal’s **bloodline is always inherited from the Mare**, meaning the **mother's lineage determines the horse’s natural racing specialization**.
- The **breed type**, however, is defined by both parents and affects **trait inheritance, genetic stability, and rarity**.
- **Legendary breeds** have a **higher probability of retaining strong traits**, ensuring a minimum **quality threshold** for offspring.

Because of these inheritance mechanics, **selecting the right Mare and Stud is crucial** to achieving the **desired genetic mix** for competitive racing and future breeding potential.

## 6️⃣ Breed Licenses & Controlled Scarcity

Unlike **unrestricted breeding systems**, MetaHoof’s breeding economy is **regulated by Breed License Uniqs**, ensuring
**scarcity and value retention**.

### 🔹 How Breed Licenses Work:

✔ **Mandatory for Breeding** – A **Breed License Uniq** is required for every new foal.  
✔ **Limited & Controlled Supply** – Certain licenses are **class-restricted, time-gated, or event-exclusive**.  
✔ **Prevents Market Oversaturation** – By requiring **licenses for breeding**, MetaHoof ensures **foals retain economic
value** over time.

Players can **acquire Breed Licenses through:**

- **Marketplace purchases** 💰 (Tradeable NFTs).
- **Seasonal rewards** 🏆 (Earned via competitions or events).
- **Limited-time drops** 🎟 (Available in breeding seasons).

Breed Licenses add **strategic depth**, making breeding a **deliberate, valuable decision rather than an unlimited
process**.

## 7️⃣ Breeding Cooldown & Generational Limits

> **Strategic Bloodline Management Through Controlled Breeding Cycles**

In **MetaHoof**, breeding is **a deliberate, strategic process**—not an unlimited action. To maintain **bloodline value, market balance, and long-term sustainability**, every horse experiences a **breeding cooldown** after mating.

Breeding cooldown ensures that **foals remain scarce**, preventing overpopulation while encouraging **careful breeding decisions**.

---

### 🔹 Understanding Cooldown Mechanics

After breeding, both the **stallion and mare** enter a **cooldown period** before they can breed again. However, their cooldown durations differ:

- **Mares have a longer cooldown** since they carry the foal, acting as the primary **bottleneck** in horse population growth.
- **Stallions recover faster** but have a **limited lifetime breeding capacity** (except for Genesis horses).

The **cooldown duration scales by generation**, meaning that higher-generation horses **require more time** between breedings.

---

### 🔹 Breeding Cooldown & Lifetime Limits

| **Generation** | **Max Breedings (Lifetime)** | **Cooldown (Stallions)** | **Cooldown (Mares)** | **Max Foals per Year** |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Genesis (G1)** | **Unlimited** | **14 days** | **28 days** | **12-13** |
| **G2** | **8 total** | **18 days** | **35 days** | **6-8** |
| **G3** | **5 total** | **25 days** | **45 days** | **4-5** |
| **G4+** | **3 total** | **40 days** | **60 days** | **2-3** |

📌 **Key Takeaways:**
- **Mares control the breeding pace**, limiting how quickly new foals enter the game.
- **Genesis horses (G1) have unlimited breeding potential** but still require cooldowns.
- **Higher generations (G3, G4+) take longer to breed**, ensuring that elite bloodlines remain rare.
- **The yearly foal output per horse is controlled**, preventing market oversaturation.

---

### 🔹 Why Generational Cooldown Increases?

Each new generation inherits a **progressively longer breeding cooldown** to:

✅ **Control horse supply** and avoid excessive foal minting.  
✅ **Increase strategic decision-making**, making each breeding choice impactful.  
✅ **Preserve value in bloodlines** by making high-generation horses rarer.  
✅ **Encourage a balanced player economy**, preventing breeding monopolies.

By gradually increasing cooldown times per generation, MetaHoof ensures that **breeding remains a rewarding challenge rather than an unlimited mass-production system**.

---

### 🔹 Strategic Implications of Cooldowns

**🏆 Bloodline Planning:** Players must **carefully choose when to breed** based on cooldowns, ensuring that they don’t waste valuable breeding slots.

**🏇 Racing vs. Breeding:** Since **higher-generation horses take longer to breed**, they become **more valuable for racing** rather than just being used as breeding stock.

**📉 Supply & Demand:** The cooldown system ensures that foals remain **a valuable asset** rather than being overproduced, maintaining a **healthy in-game economy**.

---

### 🔹 Future Considerations: Dynamic Cooldown Events

MetaHoof may introduce **limited-time breeding events**, where cooldowns are temporarily reduced, offering:

✔ **Seasonal Breeding Windows** → Certain months with shorter cooldowns.  
✔ **Cooldown Reduction Items** → Rare items that **slightly decrease cooldown times**.  
✔ **Special Event Foals** → Exclusive foals **born only in specific breeding cycles**.

This creates a **dynamic breeding economy**, where players must adapt their **breeding strategies** based on timing, cooldowns, and market conditions.

---

### 🔹 Conclusion

Breeding cooldowns in MetaHoof create a **balanced, strategic, and rewarding ecosystem**, where **every breeding decision matters**. With **longer cooldowns per generation**, **lifetime breeding caps**, and **carefully designed supply mechanics**, MetaHoof ensures that bloodlines **retain value, rarity, and competitive importance**.

This system **keeps the economy healthy, the gameplay engaging, and the breeding process an exciting challenge** for all players.
