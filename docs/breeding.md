# Breeding System & Genetics in MetaHoof <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

> Building Champions Through Strategy & Bloodline Mastery

## 1️⃣ Introduction to Breeding in MetaHoof

Breeding is one of the **most strategic and rewarding mechanics** in MetaHoof, allowing players to create **new
generations of racehorses** with inherited traits, unique bloodlines, and competitive advantages.

By carefully selecting parent horses, managing breed licenses, and understanding genetic probabilities, players can *
*optimize their stable for long-term success**—whether by producing elite racers, valuable marketplace assets, or
specialized breeding bloodlines.

Breeding in MetaHoof is not just about **creating more horses**—it's about **building a legacy of champions**.

## 2️⃣ How the Breeding System Works

Breeding in MetaHoof requires **two parent horses** and a **Breed License Uniq**, ensuring that every foal is **a
carefully planned genetic investment**.

### 🔹 Breeding Steps:

1. **Select Parent Horses** – Choose two compatible horses from your stable or the breeding marketplace.
2. **Use a Breed License** – Apply a **Breed License Uniq**, which defines breeding conditions such as **class,
   bloodline restrictions, and season availability**.
3. **Genetic Calculation & Trait Inheritance** – The foal’s **stats, traits, and class potential** are determined by a **genetic algorithm based on both parents**.
4. **Foal Minting** – The new horse is **minted as a unique NFT**, complete with its own **bloodline, attributes, and
   racing potential**.
5. **Growth & Development** – Newly bred foals **start untrained** and must be **raised, trained, and raced** to develop
   their full potential.

Breeding is not just about **luck**—it’s about **strategy, planning, and understanding the genetic probabilities of
inheritance**.

## 3️⃣ Bloodlines & Breed Types

MetaHoof's breeding system is designed to **preserve rarity, maintain competitive balance, and create real strategic
depth** when selecting breeding pairs.

### 🏇 Bloodline Hierarchy

Bloodlines play a **crucial role** in determining a horse’s **value, genetic stability, and performance potential**.

- **Legendary Bloodlines** 🔥 → Exclusive to **Genesis Horses**, cannot be recreated.
- **Purebred Bloodlines** 🏆 → Horses with **only one lineage**, offering more predictable traits.
- **Crossbreed Bloodlines** ⚡ → A mix of **two or more lineages**, offering **hybrid advantages and versatility**.

Bloodline selection impacts a horse’s **race stats, breeding potential, and resale value** in the marketplace.

## 4️⃣ Breed Types & Their Impact

Breed Type determines **how a horse interacts with the breeding system**, affecting **foal quality, genetic
predictability, and overall class progression**.

### 🔹 Breed Type Categories:

✅ **Purebred** → Horses from a **single, uninterrupted lineage**, offering **high genetic stability and strong
specialized traits**.  
✅ **Crossbreed** → Horses bred from **mixed lineages**, producing **hybrid adaptability and unpredictable traits**.  
✅ **Legendary Breed** → Exceptionally rare horses that are **only possible from Genesis Horses** and **retain exclusive
bloodline advantages**.

### 📌 Key Breeding Trade-offs:

- **Purebreds** provide **consistency**, making them reliable for **specific race strategies**.
- **Crossbreeds** may inherit a **wider range of strengths**, offering **greater adaptability**.
- **Legendary Breeds** are **scarce and high-value**, ensuring their status as **elite bloodlines**.

## 5️⃣ Trait Inheritance & Genetic Mechanics

Each foal in MetaHoof **inherits a unique combination of traits from both parents**, meaning careful **breeding
selection can refine a horse’s strengths over generations**.

### 📊 Inherited Traits:

1. **Speed** – Determines **acceleration and peak velocity**.
2. **Stamina** – Affects **endurance over long distances**.
3. **Agility** – Governs how well the horse **handles turns and obstacles**.
4. **Temperament** – Influences **race strategy effectiveness**.
5. **Hidden Genetic Traits** – Occasionally, foals **inherit rare or mutated abilities**, adding an **element of
   surprise and uniqueness** to bloodline progression.

Each trait has a **dominant-recessive probability**, meaning certain **genetic advantages may carry over or evolve
across multiple generations**.

## 6️⃣ Breed Licenses & Controlled Scarcity

Unlike **unrestricted breeding systems**, MetaHoof’s breeding economy is **regulated by Breed License Uniqs**, ensuring
**scarcity and value retention**.

### 🔹 How Breed Licenses Work:

✔ **Mandatory for Breeding** – A **Breed License Uniq** is required for every new foal.  
✔ **Limited & Controlled Supply** – Certain licenses are **class-restricted, time-gated, or event-exclusive**.  
✔ **Prevents Market Oversaturation** – By requiring **licenses for breeding**, MetaHoof ensures **foals retain economic
value** over time.

Players can **acquire Breed Licenses through:**

- **Marketplace purchases** 💰 (Tradeable NFTs).
- **Seasonal rewards** 🏆 (Earned via competitions or events).
- **Limited-time drops** 🎟 (Available in breeding seasons).

Breed Licenses add **strategic depth**, making breeding a **deliberate, valuable decision rather than an unlimited
process**.

## 7️⃣ Growth & Training After Breeding

Foals do not **enter the racing world fully developed**—they require **time, training, and proper management** to reach
their potential.

### 🍼 Development Stages:

1. **Newborn Foal** – Immediately after breeding, a foal is **minted as an NFT** but requires **growth time** before
   racing eligibility.
2. **Training & Development** – Young horses **must be trained** using **Trainer NFTs** to enhance **speed, stamina, and
   agility**.
3. **First Races & XP Progression** – New horses **compete in lower-tier races** before advancing to higher competition
   levels.
4. **Stable Reputation Impact** – Successfully bred and trained horses **increase the breeder’s stable reputation**,
   unlocking **better breeding opportunities in the future**.

Breeding in MetaHoof is about **long-term investment**, where **smart bloodline management leads to generational
improvement**.

## 8️⃣ The Marketplace & Economic Value of Breeding

Since **every horse in MetaHoof is an NFT**, breeding has **real economic consequences**, shaping **supply, demand, and
marketplace pricing**.

### 💰 How Breeding Creates Value in the Marketplace

📌 **Traders & Breeders Can Sell Foals** → Players can **breed, train, and sell** horses on the **Ultra Marketplace**.  
📌 **Bloodline Specialists Gain Reputation** → Stables with **high-performance lineages** will see **higher demand for
their offspring**.  
📌 **Crossbreeds vs. Purebreds Affect Pricing** → Some players **pay premium prices for predictable bloodlines**, while
others **seek out hybrid combinations** for unique advantages.  
📌 **Seasonal & Limited-Edition Breeding Events Drive Prices** → Special **one-time breeding opportunities** create
**rare horse NFTs with long-term value appreciation**.
