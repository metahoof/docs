Horses have an energy level represented by 8 bars, which directly impacts their performance and recovery:

- **Energy Bars:** Each race consumes a portion of the horse's energy. The energy level affects how well the horse
  performs during the race and its ability to recover afterward.
- **Genetic Influence:** The rate of energy recovery between races is influenced by the horse's genetic sequence. Some
  horses may recover energy more quickly due to their genetic traits, allowing them to perform better in subsequent
  races.

**4. Recent Form**

The recent performance history of a horse is crucial. Factors include:

- **Previous Races:** A horse’s results in recent races provide insights into its current form. Consistent performance,
  or lack thereof, affects its readiness and strategy.
- **Performance Trends:** Analysis of recent races helps in predicting how the horse might fare under similar conditions
  in the future.

- **Level 22-23:** Additional 20,000 XP required (40,000 XP total).
- **Level 23-24:** Additional 20,000 XP required (60,000 XP total).
- **Level 24-25:** Additional 20,000 XP required (80,000 XP total).
- **Max Level:** Reached at 100,000 XP.

This progression system is designed to balance the advancement of horses within MetaHoof, ensuring that as players
invest more time and resources into their horses, the challenge to achieve higher levels becomes progressively steeper.
This structure not only rewards early engagement but also adds depth to the gameplay by requiring strategic planning and
continued participation to reach the highest tiers.

**Horse Decay System:**

MetaHoof implements a horse decay system to simulate real-life aging and maintain a dynamic ecosystem:

- **Decay Mechanism:** Over time, horses will experience a gradual decline in performance and attributes if not actively
  used or maintained through races and care activities. This system is directly linked to the horse’s performance
  longevity, which is influenced by the genetic sequence.
- **Impact on Gameplay:** Performance longevity is a key factor in how a horse's capabilities decline. Horses with
  better genetic sequences may have longer performance longevity, affecting how players manage and strategize with their
  horses over time.

**Class Stability**

- Class Stability: Horses cannot be downgraded from their current class level or XP level. However, players can choose
  to maintain a horse's current class level without upgrading. This feature allows players to keep their horses in a
  stable class while managing their XP and performance strategy.

#### Balancing Over Time

As MetaHoof evolves, ongoing adjustments and balancing will be crucial to ensure a vibrant and fair gameplay
environment:

- **Regular Assessments:** The game will undergo periodic assessments to evaluate class distribution, XP earning rates,
  and overall gameplay balance.
- **Community Feedback:** Player feedback will be instrumental in identifying areas for improvement and fine-tuning game
  mechanics.
- **Adjustment Strategies:** Balancing adjustments may include XP rate adjustments, class rebalancing based on
  performance data, and introducing new features to enhance gameplay depth and longevity.

This approach not only sustains interest among players but also reinforces MetaHoof's commitment to fairness and
continuous improvement in the digital horse racing experience.

## Initial Minting

1. **Diverse Initial Minting:**

- The initial batch of genesis horses will have varying attributes and XP levels, ensuring a diverse starting
  population. This approach allows players of different experience levels to find suitable horses.

2. **Attribute Distribution:**

- Attributes are assigned using a balanced algorithm to ensure a fair distribution across classes. This helps
  maintain competitive balance and diversity within the game. For instance, while only 2% of the initial horses will
  be Class A, ensuring these top-tier horses remain rare and valuable, 40% will be Class E to accommodate new and
  learning players.

3. **Minting Ratio Example:**

- To illustrate, based on the initial allocation plan of 2.000 horses:
    - **Class E: 40%** (800 horses)
    - **Class D: 30%** (600 horses)
    - **Class C: 20%** (400 horses)
    - **Class B: 8%** (160 horses)
    - **Class A: 2%** (40 horses)

4. **Limited High-Class Horses:**

- To maintain exclusivity and prevent early market saturation, the number of high-class horses (Class A and B) in
  the initial minting phase will be limited. This strategy encourages player engagement and investment in horse
  development.
