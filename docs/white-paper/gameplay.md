## Class System

MetaHoof incorporates a detailed class system and XP leveling mechanics that ensure a balanced and competitive
environment for all players. Horses are categorized into classes based on their abilities and experience, from novice to
expert. The class system allows horses to compete against similarly skilled opponents, providing fair and exciting
competitions.

**Class System:**

- **Class E (Novice):** Horses start with basic abilities, suitable for new players learning the game mechanics.
- **Class D (Beginner):** A step up from Novice, these horses have shown some potential in races.
- **Class C (Intermediate):** Mid-level horses with a decent track record and enhanced attributes.
- **Class B (Advanced):** Competent racers that consistently perform well in more challenging races.
- **Class A (Expert):** The top-tier horses with exceptional attributes, capable of competing in the most prestigious
  races.

**XP and Leveling:**

- **Earning XP:** Horses gain experience points (XP) by participating in races. The amount of XP earned is influenced by
  their performance, race conditions, and the class of the race.
- **Leveling Up:** Accumulating sufficient XP allows a horse to level up, potentially advancing to a higher class.
  Leveling up can also unlock new abilities or improve existing ones.

**Horse Decay System:**

MetaHoof implements a horse decay system to simulate real-life aging and maintain a dynamic ecosystem:

- **Decay Mechanism:** Over time, horses will experience a gradual decline in performance and attributes if not actively
  used or maintained through races and care activities. This system is directly linked to the horse’s performance
  longevity, which is influenced by the genetic sequence.
- **Impact on Gameplay:** Performance longevity is a key factor in how a horse's capabilities decline. Horses with
  better genetic sequences may have longer performance longevity, affecting how players manage and strategize with their
  horses over time.

**Class Stability**

- Class Stability: Horses cannot be downgraded from their current class level or XP level. However, players can choose
  to maintain a horse's current class level without upgrading. This feature allows players to keep their horses in a
  stable class while managing their XP and performance strategy.

#### Balancing Over Time

As MetaHoof evolves, ongoing adjustments and balancing will be crucial to ensure a vibrant and fair gameplay
environment:

- **Regular Assessments:** The game will undergo periodic assessments to evaluate class distribution, XP earning rates,
  and overall gameplay balance.

  mechanics.
- **Adjustment Strategies:** Balancing adjustments may include XP rate adjustments, class rebalancing based on
  performance data, and introducing new features to enhance gameplay depth and longevity.

This approach not only sustains interest among players but also reinforces MetaHoof's commitment to fairness and
continuous improvement in the digital horse racing experience.

## Initial Minting

1. **Diverse Initial Minting:**

- The initial batch of genesis horses will have varying attributes and XP levels, ensuring a diverse starting
  population. This approach allows players of different experience levels to find suitable horses.

2. **Attribute Distribution:**

- Attributes are assigned using a balanced algorithm to ensure a fair distribution across classes. This helps
  maintain competitive balance and diversity within the game. For instance, while only 2% of the initial horses will
  be Class A, ensuring these top-tier horses remain rare and valuable, 40% will be Class E to accommodate new and
  learning players.

3. **Minting Ratio Example:**

- To illustrate, based on the initial allocation plan of 2.000 horses:
    - **Class E: 40%** (800 horses)
    - **Class D: 30%** (600 horses)
    - **Class C: 20%** (400 horses)
    - **Class B: 8%** (160 horses)
    - **Class A: 2%** (40 horses)

4. **Limited High-Class Horses:**

- To maintain exclusivity and prevent early market saturation, the number of high-class horses (Class A and B) in
  the initial minting phase will be limited. This strategy encourages player engagement and investment in horse
  development.
