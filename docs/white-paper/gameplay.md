- **Energy Bars:** Each race consumes a portion of the horse's energy. The energy level affects how well the horse
  performs during the race and its ability to recover afterward.
- **Genetic Influence:** The rate of energy recovery between races is influenced by the horse's genetic sequence. Some
  horses may recover energy more quickly due to their genetic traits, allowing them to perform better in subsequent
  races.

**4. Recent Form**

The recent performance history of a horse is crucial. Factors include:

- **Previous Races:** A horse’s results in recent races provide insights into its current form. Consistent performance,
  or lack thereof, affects its readiness and strategy.
- **Performance Trends:** Analysis of recent races helps in predicting how the horse might fare under similar conditions
  in the future.

By detailing the various race formats, prize distributions, and special events, MetaHoof ensures that players and
stakeholders have a clear understanding of how races are conducted and how rewards are allocated. This structured
approach enhances the gaming experience and fosters a fair and engaging environment for all participants.

## Shared Prize

In MetaHoof, the **Shared Prize Mechanism** is designed to foster a dynamic and engaging racing environment by
redistributing value from various activities within the platform. This mechanism ensures that contributions from races,
license factories, resells, and other activities can enhance the prize pool for specific races and reward players
accordingly. Here’s how the Shared Prize Mechanism works:

### 1. **Contributors to Shared Prizes**

Several activities contribute to the shared prize pool, which is then utilized for special races with sponsored prizes.
The primary contributors are:

- **Races:** A portion of the entry fees and other race-related revenues are allocated to the shared prize pool. This
  contributes to larger and more attractive prize pools for future races.
- **License Factories:** Revenue generated from the sale of horse licenses and breeding rights is partially directed
  into the shared prize pool. This incentivizes the creation and trading of high-quality horses.
- **Resells:** Transactions involving the resale of horses, equipment, or other in-game assets contribute a percentage
  to the shared prize pool. This creates a continuous loop of value reinvestment into the community.
- **Stud Fees:** Fees paid for breeding rights, or stud services, contribute to the shared prize pool. This encourages
  the
  use of superior horses for breeding and supports the overall prize structure.

### 2. **Sponsored Prizes**

The shared prize pool is used to fund sponsored prizes for specific races, enhancing the competitive excitement and
attracting more participants. These races are distinguished by:

- **No Entry Fee:** Sponsored races are often offered without an entry fee, making them more accessible to a wider range
  of players.
- **Enhanced Prizes:** The prize pools for these races are generally larger due to the accumulated contributions from
  the shared prize pool.

### 3. **Prize Distribution**

The distribution of prizes in sponsored races follows a structured format based on the type of race. This ensures a fair
and engaging competitive environment.

### 4. Prohibited Practices

To maintain fairness and integrity within the MetaHoof racing environment, the following practices are strictly
prohibited for shared prize races:

- Multiple Entries from the Same Stable: Entering more than one horse from the same stable in a sponsored race is
  prohibited. This prevents manipulation of race outcomes and ensures a fair competition.
- By passing the System: Any attempts to bypass the system, such as collusion or exploiting loopholes to gain an unfair
  advantage, are strictly prohibited. Such actions undermine the integrity of the competition and will not be tolerated.

> **Consequences:** Violation of these prohibited practices may result in penalties, including disqualification from
> races and
> potential bans from the MetaHoof platform. We are committed to ensuring a fair and competitive environment for all
> players.

### 5. **Transparency and Updates**

- **Visibility:** Players can view the current status of the shared prize pool and upcoming sponsored races through the
  MetaHoof platform and On-Chain tables. Transparency ensures that all participants are aware of how the shared prize
  pool is being utilized
  and distributed.
- **Regular Updates:** The platform will provide regular updates on contributions to the shared prize pool and any
  changes to the prize distribution policies. This helps maintain trust and engagement within the community.

By participating in the MetaHoof ecosystem, players contribute to and benefit from the Shared Prize Mechanism, creating
a vibrant and competitive environment where the rewards are reflective of community engagement and contributions.

## Class System

MetaHoof incorporates a detailed class system and XP leveling mechanics that ensure a balanced and competitive
environment for all players. Horses are categorized into classes based on their abilities and experience, from novice to
expert. The class system allows horses to compete against similarly skilled opponents, providing fair and exciting
competitions.

### Class System

- **Class E (Novice):** Horses start with basic abilities, suitable for new players learning the game mechanics.
- **Class D (Beginner):** A step up from Novice, these horses have shown some potential in races.

  races.

### XP Level Progression System

In MetaHoof, the XP Level Progression System is designed to simulate the development and growth of horses as they
advance through different classes. Each class has a defined XP requirement for leveling up, ensuring a structured and
balanced progression system. The required XP to advance to the next level increases with each class, reflecting the
growing challenges and complexity as horses evolve from novices to experts.

**Level Progression Explanation**

- **Class E (Novice):** The entry-level class where horses require a relatively low amount of XP to level up, reflecting
  their novice status. Each level within this class requires 1,000 XP to progress, allowing new players to quickly gain
  initial levels and understand the game mechanics.

- **Class D (Beginner):** As horses evolve, the XP required to level up increases. In Class D, each level requires 2,500
  XP, representing the horse’s growth through participation in more competitive races and training.

- **Class C (Intermediate):** Horses in this class have developed more significant attributes and require more effort to
  level up. Each level in Class C requires 5,000 XP, highlighting the transition from beginner to more advanced racing.

- **Class B (Advanced):** At this stage, horses are seasoned competitors. Each level in Class B requires 10,000 XP,
  reflecting the intense competition and the need for strategic planning to advance further.

- **Class A (Expert):** The highest tier where horses are at the peak of their abilities. Each level within Class A
  requires 20,000 XP, symbolizing the elite status of these horses and the substantial effort required to maintain and
  improve their performance.

**XP Level Progression Table**

The following table outlines the XP required for each level within each class, providing a clear pathway for players as
they aim to evolve their horses:

This progression system is designed to balance the advancement of horses within MetaHoof, ensuring that as players
invest more time and resources into their horses, the challenge to achieve higher levels becomes progressively steeper.
This structure not only rewards early engagement but also adds depth to the gameplay by requiring strategic planning and
continued participation to reach the highest tiers.

**Horse Decay System:**

MetaHoof implements a horse decay system to simulate real-life aging and maintain a dynamic ecosystem:

- **Decay Mechanism:** Over time, horses will experience a gradual decline in performance and attributes if not actively
  used or maintained through races and care activities. This system is directly linked to the horse’s performance
  longevity, which is influenced by the genetic sequence.
- **Impact on Gameplay:** Performance longevity is a key factor in how a horse's capabilities decline. Horses with
  better genetic sequences may have longer performance longevity, affecting how players manage and strategize with their
  horses over time.

**Class Stability**

- Class Stability: Horses cannot be downgraded from their current class level or XP level. However, players can choose
  to maintain a horse's current class level without upgrading. This feature allows players to keep their horses in a
  stable class while managing their XP and performance strategy.

#### Balancing Over Time

As MetaHoof evolves, ongoing adjustments and balancing will be crucial to ensure a vibrant and fair gameplay
environment:

- **Regular Assessments:** The game will undergo periodic assessments to evaluate class distribution, XP earning rates,
  and overall gameplay balance.
- **Community Feedback:** Player feedback will be instrumental in identifying areas for improvement and fine-tuning game
  mechanics.
- **Adjustment Strategies:** Balancing adjustments may include XP rate adjustments, class rebalancing based on
  performance data, and introducing new features to enhance gameplay depth and longevity.

This approach not only sustains interest among players but also reinforces MetaHoof's commitment to fairness and
continuous improvement in the digital horse racing experience.

## Initial Minting

1. **Diverse Initial Minting:**

- The initial batch of genesis horses will have varying attributes and XP levels, ensuring a diverse starting
  population. This approach allows players of different experience levels to find suitable horses.

2. **Attribute Distribution:**

- Attributes are assigned using a balanced algorithm to ensure a fair distribution across classes. This helps
  maintain competitive balance and diversity within the game. For instance, while only 2% of the initial horses will
  be Class A, ensuring these top-tier horses remain rare and valuable, 40% will be Class E to accommodate new and
  learning players.

3. **Minting Ratio Example:**

- To illustrate, based on the initial allocation plan of 2.000 horses:
    - **Class E: 40%** (800 horses)
    - **Class D: 30%** (600 horses)
    - **Class C: 20%** (400 horses)
    - **Class B: 8%** (160 horses)
    - **Class A: 2%** (40 horses)

4. **Limited High-Class Horses:**

- To maintain exclusivity and prevent early market saturation, the number of high-class horses (Class A and B) in
  the initial minting phase will be limited. This strategy encourages player engagement and investment in horse
  development.
