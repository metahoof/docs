## Stud Offers

### **Overview**

In MetaHoof, the ability for players to offer their stallion horses for breeding in the open market is a central feature
that drives the game’s breeding mechanics. To ensure a balanced and fair marketplace, it is essential to establish
**base minimum values** for stud offers. These values serve to prevent market deterioration, ensure fair compensation
for
stallion owners, and maintain overall market stability.

### **Purpose of Base Minimum Values**

1. **Prevent Devaluation:**

- **Objective:** Establishing base minimum values helps avoid the flooding of the market with underpriced stud offers,
  which could lead to the devaluation of high-quality stallions.
- **Impact:** This prevents the erosion of value and maintains the integrity of stallion offerings.

2. **Ensure Fair Compensation:**

- **Objective:** Minimum values ensure that stallion owners are compensated fairly for their breeding services,
  reflecting the quality and attributes of their horses.
- **Impact:** This promotes fairness and equity in the market.

3. **Market Stability:**

- **Objective:** By setting minimum values, we maintain a balanced marketplace, preventing extreme fluctuations in asset
  values and ensuring consistency.
- **Impact:** This supports a healthy and sustainable economic environment.

### **Factors Influencing Minimum Values**

1. **Class and Attributes:**

- **Consideration:** The class of the stallion (E, D, C, B, A) and its attributes (speed, stamina, agility, etc.) are
  fundamental in determining the minimum offer value.
- **Impact:** Reflects the inherent value and capabilities of each stallion.

2. **Market Demand:**

- **Consideration:** Current demand for breeding services within each class influences minimum values. Higher demand may
  justify higher minimums.
- **Impact:** Aligns pricing with market conditions.

3. **Breeding Success Rate:**

- **Consideration:** Stallions with higher success rates in producing quality offspring may command higher minimum
  values.
- **Impact:** Ensures that successful stallions are valued appropriately.

4. **Historical Data:**

- **Consideration:** Historical data on stud offers helps set realistic and competitive minimum values based on past
  transactions.
- **Impact:** Provides a benchmark for establishing fair pricing.

### **Proposed Minimum Values by Class**

- **Class E Stallions:**
    - **Base Minimum Value:** $5 per breeding
    - **Rationale:** Designed for entry-level players, making it affordable while ensuring fair compensation for basic
      breeding capabilities.

- **Class D Stallions:**
    - **Base Minimum Value:** $10 per breeding
    - **Rationale:** Reflects the improved attributes and potential of Class D stallions, accommodating players
      advancing from Class E.

- **Class C Stallions:**
    - **Base Minimum Value:** $20 per breeding
    - **Rationale:** For intermediate players, this value reflects the advanced attributes and higher quality of Class C
      stallions.

- **Class B Stallions:**
    - **Base Minimum Value:** $40 per breeding
    - **Rationale:** Represents high-performing stallions, ensuring fair compensation for their premium attributes and
      competitive edge.

- **Class A Stallions:**
    - **Base Minimum Value:** $75 per breeding
    - **Rationale:** For top-tier stallions with exceptional attributes, this premium minimum value maintains their
      exclusivity and high value.

### Adjusting Minimum Values

In the dynamic environment of MetaHoof, maintaining a fair and balanced marketplace is crucial for ensuring a positive
and engaging experience for all players. As the game evolves, player behaviors, market conditions, and economic factors
can shift, potentially impacting the effectiveness of established minimum values for stud offers. To adapt to these
changes and uphold the integrity of the marketplace, MetaHoof will actively engage in adjusting minimum values. This
proactive approach is essential for maintaining market stability, fairness, and relevance in response to the evolving
game ecosystem.

1. **Market Feedback:**

- **Approach:** Regularly review player feedback and market trends to adjust minimum values as needed.
- **Impact:** Ensures that minimum values remain relevant and effective.

2. **Economic Analysis:**

- **Approach:** Perform periodic economic analyses to assess the impact of minimum values and make adjustments to
  prevent market saturation or inflation.
- **Impact:** Maintains a stable in-game economy.

3. **Special Events:**
