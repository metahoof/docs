allocated across breeding, racing entries, and marketplace transactions.

### Fee Allocation and Purpose

engagement. The allocation of funds from racing entry fees is divided into three main pools:

**1. Shared Prize Pool**:

      competitive nature of races and make them more attractive to players.
- **Impact**:
    - Increases the allure of participating in MetaHoof races by offering more substantial rewards, thereby attracting
      more participants and driving engagement.

**2. Ambassador Pool**:

    - To compensate ambassadors and influencers for their efforts in promoting MetaHoof and driving community
      engagement. This includes content creation, promotion, and interaction with the user base.
- **Impact**:

      platform's reach and building a vibrant community.

**3. Platform Pool**:

      founders as part of their compensation for managing and overseeing the platform’s operations.
- **Impact**:
    - Ensures the platform remains functional, secure, and up-to-date. The funds are used to continuously improve user
      experience, sustain long-term growth, and compensate key personnel involved in the platform’s success.

### Racing Entry Fees

Racing entry fees are a key component of the MetaHoof platform’s revenue model. The fees are structured to support both
the platform's ongoing operations and incentivize community involvement.

**Fee Structure:**

- **Total Entry Fee**: The entry fee paid by participants for joining a race.
- **Platform Fee Deduction**: A fixed percentage of the total entry fee is retained as the platform fee.

**Platform Fee Breakdown**:

- **Platform Fee**: 10% (1000 basis points) of the total entry fee amount is taken as the platform fee.

**Distribution of Platform Fee**:

From the 10% (1000 basis points) deducted as the platform fee, the allocation is as follows:

- **Shared Prize Pool**: 20% of the platform fee (which is 2000 basis points or 20% of the total entry fee).
- **Ambassador Pool**: 2.5% of the platform fee (which is 500 basis points or 5% of the total entry fee).

**Detailed Distribution Table**:

| Allocation            | Basis Points of Total Entry Fee | Percentage of Total Entry Fee                |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Platform Fee**      | 1000                            | 10%                                          |
| **Shared Prize Pool** | 2000                            | 20% of Platform Fee (2% of Total Entry Fee)  |
| **Ambassador Pool**   | 500                             | 5% of Platform Fee (0.5% of Total Entry Fee) |

**Example Calculation**:

If the total entry fee for a race is 1,000 UOS:

- **Total Platform Fee**: 10% of 1,000 UOS = 100 UOS
    - **Shared Prize Pool**: 20% of 100 UOS = 20 UOS
    - **Ambassador Pool**: 2.5% of 100 UOS = 2.50 UOS

Therefore, out of the 1,000 UOS entry fee:

- **100 UOS** is allocated as the platform fee.
- **20 UOS** goes to the Shared Prize Pool.
- **2.50 UOS** goes to the Ambassador Pool.

### Breeding Fees

Breeding fees play a crucial role in the MetaHoof ecosystem, contributing to both the platform’s sustainability and
rewarding the community. This section outlines the distribution model for revenue generated from breed licenses,
specifying how the funds are allocated across different pools.

#### Breed License Factory

The Breed License Factory is a key component of MetaHoof’s breeding system, where users acquire licenses to breed their
horses. The revenue generated from these breed licenses is allocated as follows:

**Revenue Allocation:**

- **Shared Prize Pool**: 70% of the revenue from breed licenses.
- **Ambassador Pool**: 10% of the revenue from breed licenses.
- **Platform Shared**: 10% of the revenue supports platform operations.

> **Note:** Sponsored breed licenses acquired through platform quests or other promotional methods will not contribute
> to
> these revenue pools. These sponsored licenses are provided at no cost to the user and are designed to promote the
> platform and encourage participation through special events or promotional campaigns. As such, they do not generate
> revenue that contributes to the Shared Prize Pool, Ambassador Pool, or Platform Shared.

**Detailed Allocation Table**:

| Allocation            | Basis Points | Percentage |
|-----------------------|--------------|------------|
| **Shared Prize Pool** | -            | 70%        |
| **Ambassador Pool**   | -            | 10%        |
| **Platform Shared**   | -            | 10%        |

**Example Calculation**:

If the revenue from breed licenses for a given period is $100,000:

- **Shared Prize Pool**: 70% of 100,000 UOS = 70,000 UOS
- **Ambassador Pool**: 10% of 100,000 UOS = 10,000 UOS
- **Platform Shared**: 10% of 100,000 UOS = 10,000 UOS

Thus, out of the 100,000 UOS in revenue from breed licenses:

- **70,000 UOS** is allocated to the Shared Prize Pool.
- **10,000 UOS** is allocated to the Ambassador Pool.
- **10,000 UOS** is allocated to the Platform Shared.

By clearly defining the allocation of revenue from breed licenses, MetaHoof ensures a transparent and fair distribution
model that supports both the platform’s operational needs and rewards key contributors. This detailed breakdown helps
maintain trust within the community and ensures effective use of resources to promote the platform’s growth.
