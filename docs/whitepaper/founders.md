### üîÑ Revenue Distribution Logic

Royalties paid to the co-creator are based on **net revenue**, defined as the remaining value after mandatory Ultra platform fees (15%) and applicable Brazilian taxes on digital goods (approx. 15%) are deducted.

#### Example: Sale of $30

| Description                     | Value   |
| ------------------------------ | ------- |
| Gross Sale                     | $30.00  |
| Less: Platform Fee (15%)       | ‚Äì$4.50  |
| Less: Brazilian VAT (15%)      | ‚Äì$4.50  |
| **Net Revenue**                | $21.00  |
| Co-Creator Share (40%)         | $8.40   |
| MetaHoof Share (60%)           | $12.60  |

This ensures co-creators receive fair value while remaining compliant with platform and regional regulations.

### üìä Collection Economics & ROI

| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Auction Start Price**         | $1,000                                 |
| **Exclusive Bloodline Minted**  | 500 horses                             |
| **Estimated Mint Price**        | $30 per horse                          |
| **Gross Primary Sale Revenue**  | 500 √ó $30 = $15,000                    |
| **Marketplace Fee (15%)**       | ‚Äì$2,250                                |

| **Net Revenue After Deductions**| $10,500                                |
| **Co-Creator Share (40%)**      | $4,200                                 |
| **MetaHoof Share (60%)**        | $6,300                                 |
