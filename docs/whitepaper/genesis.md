> **Genesis Horses – The Bedrock of MetaHoof**

## 1️⃣ What Are Genesis Horses?

**Genesis Tokens** mark the first-ever horses minted in the MetaHoof universe (Generation G1). As the inaugural bloodlines, they:

- Are **unique**, one-of-a-kind NFTs launched with our Mainnet Alpha.  
- Carry **special metadata** denoting founding status.  
- Unlock **exclusive in-game utilities** unavailable to later generations.

## 2️⃣ Scarcity & Total Supply

Genesis Horses are finite by design:

- **Total G1 Supply**: 22,000 horses will ever exist.  
- **First Generation Mint**: 2,500 horses from the total supply.

This breakdown ensures fair distribution among core community pillars:

- **Founders Allocation (535)**: Reserved for early supporters via Founders Collection Passes, recognizing their vital role in launching MetaHoof.
- **Collaboration Pass (500)**: Represents the one-of-one **MetaHoof Bloodline Forge Pass** — a ultra-exclusive NFT that empowers its holder to co-design a new Genesis bloodline, set the mint parameters, and launch 500 Genesis horses in a single drop (no further mints), unlocking full G1 capabilities.
- **Public Mint (1,465)**: Open to the wider community, providing broad access while maintaining exclusivity.

## 4️⃣ Core Utilities & Benefits

Owning a Genesis Horse delivers powerful advantages:

- **Unlimited Breeding**  
  - Breed freely with any other horse, subject only to seasonal windows and cooldowns.  
- **Founders-Only Event Access**  
  - Exclusive races, tournaments, and community showcases.  

## 5️⃣ Superior Longevity & Performance

Built for endurance—both on-track and in your portfolio:

  - More race starts before retirement, and slower performance decay.  
- **Breeding Resilience**  
  - Higher offspring success rates and stronger baseline traits.

## 6️⃣ Attribute Baselines

Genesis horses share the same trait categories—speed, endurance, agility, temperament—but start at **elite ranges**:

| Trait           | G1 Range | Later Generations |
|-----------------|---------:|------------------:|
| **Speed**       | 75–95    | 60–90             |
