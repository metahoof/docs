## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Revenue Distribution Logic

Royalties paid to the co-creator are based on **net revenue**, defined as the remaining value after mandatory platform fees (15%) and applicable Brazilian taxes on digital goods (approx. 15%) are deducted.

### Example: Sale of $30

| Description                     | Value   |
| ------------------------------ | ------- |
| Gross Sale                     | $30.00  |
| Less: Platform Fee (15%)       | ‚Äì$4.50  |
| Less: Brazilian VAT (15%)      | ‚Äì$4.50  |
| **Net Revenue**                | $21.00  |
| Co-Creator Share (40%)         | $8.40   |
| MetaHoof Share (60%)           | $12.60  |

This ensures co-creators receive fair value while remaining compliant with platform and regional regulations.
