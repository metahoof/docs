> **Mastering Champions: The Role of Trainers in MetaHoof**

## 1️⃣ Introduction to Trainers

Trainers are unique Uniq NFTs that elevate your stable’s performance through skill bonuses, fitness improvements, and strategic synergies. Assigning the right trainer to your horse can mean the difference between victory and defeat on the racetrack.

## 2️⃣ Trainer Attributes & Traits

Each Trainer NFT possesses a set of core traits defining their capabilities and rarity:

| Trait             | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**          | Category of the Uniq (e.g., Coach, Mentor, Specialist).                                                                                                                                   |
| **Rarity**        | Common, Rare, or Legendary—higher rarity unlocks more skill and synergy slots.                                                                                                            |
| **XP Multiplier** | Multiplier applied to horse XP gains when trained or raced under this trainer (e.g., 1.2×).                                                                                               |
| **Fitness Gain**  | Flat fitness points awarded per race or training session (e.g., +2 fitness).                                                                                                              |
| **Personality**   | Defines trainer’s style (e.g., Aggressive, Calm, Analytical).                                                                                                                             |
| **Specialty**     | Specific focus area (e.g., Sprint Training, Endurance Drills, Conditioning).                                                                                                              |
| **Skill Slots**   | **Skill 1**, **Skill 2**, **Skill 3**: Unique abilities that provide race-day bonuses. Check [Trainer Skills](./trainers-skills.md) for references.                                       |
| **Synergy Slots** | **Synergy 1**, **Synergy 2**, **Synergy 3**: Enhanced effects when paired with horses sharing matching bloodlines/traits. Check [Trainer Synergies](./trainers-synergy.md) for references. |

## 3️⃣ How Trainer Contracts Work

Upon minting, each Trainer NFT is preloaded with **30 Trainer Contracts**. Each contract represents one use in a race or training session.

- **Contract Consumption**: Every assignment to a horse (race or training) consumes one contract.
- **Replenishment**: Purchase additional contracts on the **Launchpad** or **Marketplace**, then assign them to your trainer NFT to extend its utility.
- **Management**: Monitor remaining contracts and reassign via your MetaHoof Dashboard.

## 4️⃣ Strategic Benefits of Trainers

- **Accelerated XP Growth**: High **XP Multiplier** accelerates level progression and unlocks stats sooner.
- **Enhanced Fitness**: Improved **Fitness Gain** allows more frequent competitions/training with less downtime.
- **Skill Synergies**: Leverage **Skill** and **Synergy** slots—pair with horses whose traits amplify these bonuses.
- **Rarity Perks**:
  - **Rare Trainers**: +1 Skill & Synergy slot.
  - **Legendary Trainers**: +2 Skill slots and 10% contract consumption reduction.

## 5️⃣ Assigning & Managing Trainers

1. **Select a Trainer**: From your stable or the Marketplace.
2. **Assign to Horse**: Via the MetaHoof Dashboard.
3. **Allocate Contracts**: Set how many contracts to use for upcoming sessions.
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track consumption and replenish as needed.

## 6️⃣ Marketplace & Economy

- **Trainer Sales**: Buy trainers and contract bundles on the **MetaHoof Marketplace** or during **Launchpad** drops.
- **Trainer Trading**: Trainers (with unused contracts) are tradable NFTs—capitalizing on high-demand periods.
- **Contract-Only Listings**: Sell surplus Trainer Contracts independently to support ecosystem demand.
