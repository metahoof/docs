> Understanding the synergy between a Trainer and your Horse.

## Synergy Slots by Rarity

- **Common** → 1 synergy
- **Rare** → 2 synergies
- **Legendary** → 3 synergies

## How Synergies Are Chosen

- Each slot is filled by a random pick from the full list—every option is equally likely.
- No repeats: you’ll get unique synergies in each slot.

Trainers with relevant synergies may also be eligible for special races or custom event types requiring specific specializations.

## Synergy List & Effects

Each synergy represents a specialization of the trainer, allowing better command over horses in those specific contexts. Synergies improve how well horses follow strategic instructions and how effectively they handle their temperament. Additionally, trainers with certain synergies may become eligible for exclusive or custom race events.

## Tips for Using Synergies

- **Preview** upcoming race conditions (track & weather) and pick matching synergies.
- **Pair** “Bloodline: X” with horses of that bloodline for heritage bonuses.
- **Stack** multiple synergies in one race for extra edge (e.g., dirt + rain + purebred).
