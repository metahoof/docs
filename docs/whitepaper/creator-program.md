> Turn your influence into in-game impact. Grow the MetaHoofverse—and earn real UOS rewards based on what your community does.

The **MetaHoof Creator Program** is a performance-based referral initiative that empowers creators, influencers, and community leaders to grow the MetaHoof ecosystem and earn rewards in UOS. Unlike traditional Web2 referral systems, this program is deeply integrated with MetaHoof’s game economy, ensuring that value flows back to those who bring engaged, active players into the game.

This is not about empty signups — it’s about bringing new **racers**, **breeders**, and **collectors** into the MetaHoofverse.

## 1️⃣ **Program Overview**

The Creator Program is designed to reward based on **in-game actions** performed by referred players. When a creator brings in a new user who actively plays, mints NFTs, breeds, races, or trades — **the creator earns UOS rewards**.

The program is structured in **three tiers**, with each level unlocking greater rewards and visibility. Progression is based on real performance, not social clout.

## 2️⃣ **Eligible Revenue Sources & Reward Structure**

Referred users generate rewards for creators when they take meaningful economic actions within MetaHoof. Below is a breakdown of eligible actions and their associated referral rewards:

| **Stud Fees**                                    | 1%          | 1.5%     | 2%         | Applies when referred user pays a breeding fee                                    |

> ⚠️ _Only transactions performed using UOS are eligible for referral rewards. FIAT-based purchases are excluded from the program._

::: info Notes:

- "MetaHoof’s cut" refers to the portion of the entry fee that goes to the game (not the prize pool).
- "Marketplace Royalties" are calculated from the fees collected on trades initiated by referred users. And only transactoins promoted by MetaHoof Marketplace are elegible.

### 💸 Sample Reward Potential

To give you a clearer picture of what’s possible, here are a few real-world examples based on actual in-game prices:

| Action          | Example Price (USD / UOS) | Rookie (T1) | Pro (T2) | Elite (T3) |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Mint Horse NFT  | $20 / 400 UOS             | 8 UOS       | 12 UOS   | 16 UOS     |
| Buy Trainer NFT | $10 / 200 UOS             | 4 UOS       | 6 UOS    | 8 UOS      |
| Entry Race Fee  | $10 / 200 UOS             | 10 UOS      | 15 UOS   | 20 UOS     |
| Pay Breed Fee   | $15 / 300 UOS             | 15 UOS      | 22.5 UOS | 30 UOS     |
| Pay Stud Fee    | $5 / 100 UOS              | 1 UOS       | 1.5 UOS  | 2 UOS      |

_(Examples calculated using the exchange rate of 1 USD = 20 UOS. Actual in-game prices and token values may vary.)_

🧮 _How rewards are calculated:_

- Mint a Horse for 400 UOS → Elite tier gets 2% → **8 UOS**
- Entry Race Fee of 1,000 UOS → MetaHoof’s cut is ~100 UOS → 10% reward = **10 UOS**

🔥 Whether you're onboarding 10 or 10,000 players, your earnings scale with their engagement. Bring your community—and earn as they race, trade, and grow!
