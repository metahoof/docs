# 🐎 MetaHoof Creator Program

The **MetaHoof Creator Program** is a performance-based referral initiative that empowers creators, influencers, and community leaders to grow the MetaHoof ecosystem and earn rewards in $UOS. Unlike traditional Web2 referral systems, this program is deeply integrated with MetaHoof’s game economy, ensuring that value flows back to those who bring engaged, active players into the game.

This is not about empty signups — it’s about bringing new **racers**, **breeders**, and **collectors** into the MetaHoofverse.

## 🎯 Program Overview

The Creator Program is designed to reward based on **in-game actions** performed by referred players. When a creator brings in a new user who actively plays, mints NFTs, breeds, races, or trades — **the creator earns $UOS rewards**.

The program is structured in **three tiers**, with each level unlocking greater rewards and visibility. Progression is based on real performance, not social clout.

## 💰 Eligible Revenue Sources & Reward Structure

Referred users generate rewards for creators when they take meaningful economic actions within MetaHoof. Below is a breakdown of eligible actions and their associated referral rewards:

| Revenue Source | Rookie (T1) | Pro (T2) | Elite (T3) | Notes |

| **Marketplace Royalties** | 50% | 75% | 100% | % of royalty fee collected from referred user’s trades |
