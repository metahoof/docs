> Turn your influence into in-game impact. Grow the MetaHoofverse—and earn real $UOS rewards based on what your community does.

The **MetaHoof Creator Program** is a performance-based referral initiative that empowers creators, influencers, and community leaders to grow the MetaHoof ecosystem and earn rewards in $UOS. Unlike traditional Web2 referral systems, this program is deeply integrated with MetaHoof’s game economy, ensuring that value flows back to those who bring engaged, active players into the game.

This is not about empty signups — it’s about bringing new **racers**, **breeders**, and **collectors** into the MetaHoofverse.

## 1️⃣ **Program Overview**

The Creator Program is designed to reward based on **in-game actions** performed by referred players. When a creator brings in a new user who actively plays, mints NFTs, breeds, races, or trades — **the creator earns $UOS rewards**.

The program is structured in **three tiers**, with each level unlocking greater rewards and visibility. Progression is based on real performance, not social clout.

## 2️⃣ **Eligible Revenue Sources & Reward Structure**

Referred users generate rewards for creators when they take meaningful economic actions within MetaHoof. Below is a breakdown of eligible actions and their associated referral rewards:

| Revenue Source                                   | Rookie (T1)          | Pro (T2) | Elite (T3) | Notes                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **NFT Minting** (Horses, Trainers, Collectibles) | 1%                   | 1.5%     | 2%         | Applies only to UOS-based sales on MetaHoof Launchpad  |
| **Marketplace Royalties**                        | 50%                  | 75%      | 100%       | % of royalty fee collected from referred user’s trades |
| **Entry Fee Races** (MetaHoof-created races)     | 5% of MetaHoof’s cut | 7.5%     | 10%        | Applies only to entry fees paid by referred users      |
| **Stud Fees**                                    | 1%                   | 1.5%     | 2%         | Applies when referred user pays a breeding fee         |

> ⚠️ _Only transactions performed using $UOS are eligible for referral rewards. FIAT-based purchases are excluded from the program._

::: info Notes:
- "MetaHoof’s cut" refers to the portion of the entry fee that goes to the game (not the prize pool).  
- "Marketplace Royalties" are calculated from the fees collected on trades initiated by referred users.

### 💸 Sample Reward Potential

To give you a clearer picture of what’s possible, here are a few real-world examples based on actual in-game prices:

| Action          | Example Price (USD / $UOS) | Rookie (T1) | Pro (T2) | Elite (T3) |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Mint Horse NFT  | $20 / 400 $UOS             | 8 $UOS      | 12 $UOS  | 16 $UOS    |
| Buy Trainer NFT | $10 / 200 $UOS             | 4 $UOS      | 6 $UOS   | 8 $UOS     |
| Entry Race Fee  | $10 / 200 $UOS             | 10 $UOS     | 15 $UOS  | 20 $UOS    |
| Pay Stud Fee    | $5 / 100 $UOS              | 1 $UOS      | 1.5 $UOS | 2 $UOS     |

_(Examples calculated using the exchange rate of 1 USD = 20 $UOS. Actual in-game prices and token values may vary.)_

🧮 *How rewards are calculated:*  
- Mint a Horse for 400 $UOS → Elite tier gets 2% → **8 $UOS**  
- Entry Race Fee of 200 $UOS → MetaHoof’s cut is ~100 $UOS → 10% reward = **10 $UOS**

🔥 Whether you're onboarding 10 or 10,000 players, your earnings scale with their engagement. Bring your community—and earn as they race, trade, and grow!

### 📈 Scaled Reward Example

Let's see how your earnings could scale based on the number of active referred users:

| Action          | Unit Reward (Elite) | 10 Users     | 100 Users      | 1,000 Users     |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| Mint Horse NFT  | 16 $UOS             | 160 $UOS     | 1,600 $UOS     | 16,000 $UOS     |
| Buy Trainer NFT | 8 $UOS              | 80 $UOS      | 800 $UOS       | 8,000 $UOS      |
| Entry Race Fee  | 20 $UOS             | 200 $UOS     | 2,000 $UOS     | 20,000 $UOS     |
| Pay Stud Fee    | 2 $UOS              | 20 $UOS      | 200 $UOS       | 2,000 $UOS      |
| **Total**       | —                   | <span style="color:#00c853;font-weight:bold">460 $UOS</span> | <span style="color:#00c853;font-weight:bold">4,600 $UOS</span> | <span style="color:#00c853;font-weight:bold">46,000 $UOS</span> |

_These examples assume all users perform each action once. In reality, active players engage repeatedly, so your actual rewards may be much higher._
