> Turn your reach into race-day rewards.

Bring your community into the **MetaHoofverse** and earn **real $UOS** every time they play, race, breed, or trade.

No gimmicks. No empty signups. Just real in-game impact, rewarded.

## 1️⃣ **What It is**

The **MetaHoof Creator Program** is built for creators who drive real action.

- You refer players. They race, breed, mint NFTs, and trade.
- You earn $UOS based on what they actually do.

It’s performance-based. Fully on-chain. Scales with your influence.

## 2️⃣ **What You Earn**

Whenever someone you refer takes an in-game action, you get a cut in UOS.
The more they do, the more you earn.

### 💸 Example Earnings (Elite Tier)

Let's see how your earnings could scale based on the number of active referred users:

| Action          | Price ($UOS) | Reward ($UOS) |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Mint Horse NFT  | 400 UOS      | 16 UOS        |
| Buy Trainer NFT | 200 UOS      | 8 UOS         |
| Entry Race Fee  | 200 UOS      | 20 UOS        |
| Pay Breed Fee   | 300 UOS      | 30 UOS        |
| Pay Stud Fee    | 100 UOS      | 2 UOS         |

Scale that up, and here’s what it could look like:

|    Users    |                    Estimated Reward ($UOS)                     |
| :---------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  10 Users   |  <span style="color:#00c853;font-weight:bold">760 UOS</span>   |
|  100 Users  | <span style="color:#00c853;font-weight:bold">7,600 UOS</span> |
| 1,000 Users | <span style="color:#00c853;font-weight:bold">76,000 UOS</span>  |

🚀 And that’s just the start. Players don’t just play once, they stick around.
