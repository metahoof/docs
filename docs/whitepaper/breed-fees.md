> **Ensuring Sustainable Horse Breeding Through a Dynamic Fee & Rarity System**

Breeding in **MetaHoof** is a **strategic investment** balancing **economic health**, **genetic integrity**, and **market engagement**. Fees are determined by:

- **Base Generation Fee**
- **Parent Rarity Multipliers**

This model incentivizes thoughtful breeding while regulating supply and preserving rarity.

## 1️⃣ Base Breeding Fees by Generation

| Generation            | Base Fee (USD) |
| --------------------- | -------------- |
| **G1 (Genesis) Mint** | $20 (fixed)    |
| **G2**                | $30            |
| **G3**                | $25            |
| **G4+**               | $22            |

## 2️⃣ Parent Rarity Multipliers

Each parent's rarity applies a multiplier to the base generation fee:

| Parent Rarity | Multiplier |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| Common        | 1.0×       |
| Rare          | 1.1×       |
| Legendary     | 1.25×      |

- **Total Fee** = Base Fee × (Multiplier of Parent A) × (Multiplier of Parent B)

### Example

For breeding two Rare parents for G2:

$$
F = B \times m_1 \times m_2
$$

Where:

- \(B = 30\) (Base Generation Fee for G2)
- \(m_1 = 1.1\) (Multiplier for Parent A)
- \(m_2 = 1.1\) (Multiplier for Parent B)

Therefore:

$$
F = 30 \times 1.1 \times 1.1 = 30 \times 1.21 = 36.3
$$

Resulting in a final breeding fee of **\$36.30**.

## 3️⃣ Offspring Rarity Probabilities

Parent combinations determine offspring rarity probabilities:

| Parent Combination    | Common (%) | Rare (%) | Legendary (%) |
| --------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Common + Common       | 80         | 15       | 5             |
| Common + Rare         | 70         | 20       | 10            |
| Common + Legendary    | 60         | 25       | 15            |
| Rare + Rare           | 50         | 30       | 20            |
| Rare + Legendary      | 40         | 35       | 25            |
| Legendary + Legendary | 30         | 40       | 30            |

This probability model aligns breeding costs with genetic outcomes, encouraging strategic parent selection.

## 4️⃣ Strategic Benefits

- **Supply Regulation**: Higher fees for rarer parents curb over-breeding.
- **Rarity Preservation**: Probability model rewards combining rare lineages.
- **Economic Incentives**: Players weigh cost vs. potential offspring value.
- **Market Dynamics**: Diverse parent pairings stimulate marketplace activity.

**Conclusion**  
MetaHoof’s updated breeding fee model leverages **generation-based costs** and **parent rarity multipliers**, underpinned by a **probabilistic rarity table**, to balance supply, preserve genetic integrity, and drive a dynamic breeding economy.
