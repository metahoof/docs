> The Cost of Creating Champions

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ How Breed Fees Are Calculated

Breeding in MetaHoof comes with **a dynamic fee structure**, ensuring that the **rarity, quality, and lineage** of
horses are properly valued. The total **Breed Fee** is determined by **three key factors**:

‚úÖ **Breed Type** ‚Üí The genetic complexity of the pairing.  
‚úÖ **Generation** ‚Üí The rarity and lineage of the offspring.  
‚úÖ **Class** ‚Üí The competitive tier of the horses involved.

By combining these factors, MetaHoof ensures **a balanced breeding economy**, rewarding **strategic pairings and
high-value bloodlines**.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Breed Type & Base Fees

The **Breed Type** determines the **base cost** of breeding, reflecting **genetic predictability, rarity, and bloodline
stability**.

### üîπ Breed Type Categories

| **Breed Type**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Base Fee** |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Purebred Breeding**   | Breeding **two horses of the same breed**. This results in **stable and predictable offspring**, making it **the most affordable option**.                                                      | **$10 USD**  |
| **Crossbreed Breeding** | Breeding **two different breeds**, leading to **increased variability and adaptability**. Due to the **unpredictability of traits**, the cost is slightly higher.                               | **$15 USD**  |
| **Legendary Breeding**  | Breeding involving **at least one Legendary horse**, which are **rare and highly valuable**. These pairings have **high potential for top-tier offspring**, making them the **most expensive**. | **$50 USD**  |

Breed Type serves as the **foundation for pricing**, ensuring that **more valuable pairings command a higher base fee**.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generation Multipliers

The **Generation** of the horses being bred further **adjusts the cost**, with **earlier generations (closer to Genesis)
requiring a higher fee**.

### üîπ Generation Cost Adjustments

| **Generation**    | **Description**                                                                                                      | **Multiplier**                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **G1 (Genesis)**  | **Genesis horses** are **the rarest and most valuable**, commanding the **highest breeding fee**.                    | **x2**                            |
| **G2 (G1 + G1)**  | The first offspring generation **inherits strong genetic traits**, making them **desirable but slightly less rare**. | **x1.5**                          |
| **G3 and Beyond** | Later generations maintain value but **gradually decrease in rarity**, reducing breeding costs over time.            | **G3: x1.2, G4: x1.1, G5+: x1.0** |

By **rewarding early-generation breeding**, MetaHoof ensures that **Genesis horses remain high-value assets**, while
also **encouraging sustainable bloodline development**.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Class Multipliers

A horse‚Äôs **Class (E ‚Üí A)** represents its **genetic strength, racing potential, and overall breeding value**.
Higher-class horses are **more desirable**, commanding **higher breeding fees**.

### üîπ Class Cost Adjustments

| **Class**                 | **Description**                                                                                                           | **Multiplier** |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Class E (Lowest Tier)** | **Entry-level horses** with basic stats, making their breeding fees **the most affordable**.                              | **x1**         |
| **Class D**               | A step up from Class E, offering **slightly better traits**.                                                              | **x1.1**       |
| **Class C**               | **Mid-tier horses** with decent stats, becoming **more desirable for breeding**.                                          | **x1.2**       |
| **Class B**               | **High-quality horses** with better attributes, making them **premium breeding choices**.                                 | **x1.3**       |
| **Class A (Top Tier)**    | The **best-performing, genetically superior horses**, leading to **elite offspring** and **commanding the highest fees**. | **x1.5**       |

Class ensures that **breeding elite-tier horses remains a high-value investment**, reinforcing the **importance of
stable management and competitive racing success**.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Final Breed Fee Calculation

To determine the **total breeding fee**, the following formula is used:

\[
\text{Total Breed Fee} = (\text{Base Fee}) \times (\text{Generation Multiplier}) \times (\text{Class Multiplier})
\]

### Example Calculations

**üìå Example 1: Breeding Two Class C G3 Crossbreeds**

- **Base Fee (Crossbreed):** $15 USD
- **Generation Multiplier (G3):** x1.2
- **Class Multiplier (Class C):** x1.2
- **Total Fee:** $15 √ó 1.2 √ó 1.2 = **$21.60 USD**

---

**üìå Example 2: Breeding Two Class A G1 Legendary Horses**

- **Base Fee (Legendary):** $50 USD
- **Generation Multiplier (G1):** x2
- **Class Multiplier (Class A):** x1.5
- **Total Fee:** $50 √ó 2 √ó 1.5 = **$150 USD**

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Strategic Considerations for Breeders

Breeding in MetaHoof is **not just about pairing any two horses**‚Äîit‚Äôs about **long-term investment and bloodline
strategy**.

### üîπ Key Strategies for Cost-Effective Breeding

‚úî **Maximize Purebred Value** ‚Äì Lower breeding fees make **Purebred horses cost-effective**, but they lack **Crossbreed
adaptability bonuses**.  
‚úî **Manage Generations Carefully** ‚Äì **G1 & G2 horses** command **higher fees** but **offer stronger offspring traits**,
making them valuable for **elite breeding programs**.  
‚úî **Class-Based Strategy** ‚Äì **Class A horses are expensive**, but their offspring may **command premium pricing in the
marketplace**.  
‚úî **Weigh Cost vs. Potential Gains** ‚Äì Investing in **a higher breeding fee now** may **yield more profitable,
high-performance foals**.

With **the right planning**, breeders can **reduce costs while maximizing genetic advantages**.
