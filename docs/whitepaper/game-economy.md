> MetaHoof‚Äôs economy is designed to be sustainable, transparent, and engaging‚Äîrewarding both casual racers and strategic long-term investors.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Economic Vision

MetaHoof unites four pillars‚ÄîNFT ownership, competitive racing, strategic breeding, and brand partnerships‚Äîinto a cohesive, player-driven ecosystem.

- **Play-to-Earn & Play-for-Fun**  
  We balance free entry points (to onboard new users) with meaningful paid experiences (for deeper engagement and rewards).  
- **Scarcity Meets Utility**  
  Finite NFT supplies (horses, trainers, consumables) are backed by ongoing utility (racing, breeding, training) to maintain demand.  
- **Governance & Growth**  
  Future on-chain governance will allow token holders to steer economic parameters (fees, sinks, new asset releases).

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ In-Game Currencies & Tokenomics

### $UOS (Ultra Native Token)  

- **Primary Medium**: Entry fees, marketplace trades, breeding/stud payments.  
- **Emission**: Awarded as race prizes and seasonal event payouts.  
- **Sinks**: Breed licenses, energy refills, trainer contracts, marketplace fees and burns.
