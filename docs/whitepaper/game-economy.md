> MetaHoof’s economy is designed to be sustainable, transparent, and engaging—rewarding both casual racers and strategic long-term investors.

## 1️⃣ Economic Vision

MetaHoof unites four pillars—NFT ownership, competitive racing, strategic breeding, and brand partnerships—into a cohesive, player-driven ecosystem.

- **Play-to-Earn & Play-for-Fun**  
  We balance free entry points (to onboard new users) with meaningful paid experiences (for deeper engagement and rewards).  
- **Scarcity Meets Utility**  
  Finite NFT supplies (horses, trainers, consumables) are backed by ongoing utility (racing, breeding, training) to maintain demand.  
- **Governance & Growth**  
  Future on-chain governance will allow token holders to steer economic parameters (fees, sinks, new asset releases).

## 2️⃣ In-Game Currencies & Tokenomics

### $UOS (Ultra Native Token)  

- **Primary Medium**: Entry fees, marketplace trades, breeding/stud payments.  
- **Emission**: Awarded as race prizes and seasonal event payouts.  
- **Sinks**: Breed licenses, energy refills, trainer contracts, marketplace fees and burns.  

## 3️⃣ Player Revenue Streams

### 3.1 🔹 Racing Rewards  

- **Free-to-Play Races**: XP, reputation, cosmetic drops — no $UOS.  
- **Paid Entrants**: $UOS prize pools split 50/30/20% across top three.  
- **Tournament & Sponsored Events**: Larger pools, bonus NFTs, brand giveaways.

#### 3.1.1 Reward Structures

MetaHoof offers multiple reward structures for paid races:

- **Win-To-All (WTA)**: Winner takes the entire prize pool.  
- **Top 2**: Prize pool split 70% to 1st place, 30% to 2nd place.  
- **Top 3**: Prize pool split 50%/30%/20% among top three finishers.  
- **Top 6**: Prize pool distributed across the top six finishers using a weighted distribution.  

#### 3.1.2 Leaderboard Competitions

Leaderboards track and reward consistent performance over time, funded through race entries and special initiatives:

- **Leaderboard Pools**: A set percentage of each paid race entry fee is allocated to weekly, monthly, and seasonal leaderboard prize pools.  
- **Team-Funded Campaigns**: MetaHoof contributes additional $UOS or NFT rewards for special leaderboard events.  
- **Gated Access**: Specific leaderboards can be restricted to holders of certain NFTs (e.g., Founders Pass, Genesis Horses, Season Pass).  
- **Automated Distribution**: Smart contracts distribute leaderboard rewards at the end of each period, ensuring transparency and speed.

### 3.2 🔹 Breeding & Stud Market  

- **Breed Licenses**: Consumable NFT purchased or earned, ensures controlled supply.  
- **Breeding Fees**: Dynamic pricing by generation and rarity, paid in $UOS.  
- **Stud Offers**: Stallion owners list per-breed fees; marketplace takes a small cut, owner earns the rest.

## 4️⃣ NFT Asset Types & Lifecycle

| Asset              | Utility & Flow                                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Horses**         | Race → Retire → Breed → Offspring 🎁 → Repeat                                  |
| **Trainers**       | Assign → Race/Train → Consume Contract → Replenish                              |
| **Breed Licenses** | Burned on use; limited seasonally to control population growth                  |
| **Energy Refills** | Burned per race; prevents infinite grinding; replenishable via purchase/events  |
| **Season Passes**  | Grant time-limited access to special races, gear, and XP boosts                 |
| **Sponsorship**    | Passes burned over events; revenue share tracked on-chain                        |

## 5️⃣ Seasonal Passes & Limited Drops

Each “season” (quarterly) introduces:

- **Season Pass NFTs**: Unlock exclusive tracks, leaderboards, and cosmetic gear.  
- **Limited Bloodline Drops**: Small mint runs (e.g. 500–1,000 horses) tied to season themes.  
- **Partner Series**: Drops co-branded with leagues, influencers, or IP holders—often bundled with real-world perks.

## 6️⃣ Sustainability & Balancing

- **Burn Mechanics**  
  - Every Breed License, Energy Refill, and Trainer Contract used is permanently removed.  
- **Prize Pool Reinvestment**  
  - A % of $UOS entry fees is routed back into seasonal and tournament pools.  
- **Fee Adjustments**  
  - Governance can tweak marketplace fees, breeding costs, and sponsor cuts to maintain equilibrium.

## 7️⃣ Future Expansions & Governance

- **Token Staking**: MHT stakers earn a share of platform revenues and unlock premium drops.  
- **On-Chain DAO**: MHT holders vote on key economic levers—new asset caps, fee revisions, sink rates.  
- **Cross-Chain Bridges**: Enable $UOS & NFT interoperability with other blockchains and DeFi protocols.

## 8️⃣ Key Takeaways

- **Multiple Earning Paths**: Race, breed, sponsor, stake, and trade.  
- **Deflationary Sinks**: Consumable NFTs and fees keep the economy healthy.  
- **Seasonal Rhythm**: Regular drops and events maintain excitement and value.  
- **Community-Driven**: Future governance rewards active participants who shape MetaHoof’s growth.
