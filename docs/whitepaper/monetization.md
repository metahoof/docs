## 1️⃣ Core Philosophy

MetaHoof is built around a fair, transparent, and player-first economy. Our monetization model is designed to reward players who engage with the game strategically and consistently—whether through racing, breeding, or collecting. Most of the value generated within MetaHoof is returned to the player ecosystem through prize pools, leaderboard incentives, and sustainable reinvestment into the game.

We believe in long-term value over short-term extraction, ensuring that every transaction—whether it's a race entry, breeding fee, or NFT purchase—contributes to a thriving, rewarding environment for all players.

This section details how MetaHoof generates revenue, how it's distributed, and how it empowers our player-driven economy.

## 2️⃣ Race Rewards

Racing is at the heart of MetaHoof—and so are the rewards. Every paid-entry race contributes to a shared prize pool that goes back to the players.
