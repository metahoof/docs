## üí∞ MetaHoof‚Äôs Monetization & Player Rewards

### üéØ Core Philosophy

MetaHoof is built around a fair, transparent, and player-first economy. Our monetization model is designed to reward players who engage with the game strategically and consistently‚Äîwhether through racing, breeding, or collecting. Most of the value generated within MetaHoof is returned to the player ecosystem through prize pools, leaderboard incentives, and sustainable reinvestment into the game.

We believe in long-term value over short-term extraction, ensuring that every transaction‚Äîwhether it's a race entry, breeding fee, or NFT purchase‚Äîcontributes to a thriving, rewarding environment for all players.

This section details how MetaHoof generates revenue, how it's distributed, and how it empowers our player-driven economy.

### üêé Race Rewards

Racing is at the heart of MetaHoof‚Äîand so are the rewards. Every paid-entry race contributes to a shared prize pool that goes back to the players.

**Revenue Distribution for Paid Races**

| Component                   | % of Entry Fees | Purpose                                        |
| --------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Player Rewards              | 90%             | Distributed among winners (WTA, Top 2/3/6)     |
| Game Development (MetaHoof) | 8%              | Reinvested into game infrastructure and growth |
| Leaderboards                | 2%              | Supports competitive leaderboard prizes        |

> Example: For a 1,000 $UOS race pool:
>
> - 900 $UOS are paid back to racers
> - 80 $UOS are reinvested in the platform
> - 20 $UOS are distributed across leaderboard pools

**Payout Types**

- **Winner-Takes-All (WTA):** Entire reward goes to first place.
- **Top Finisher Rewards:** Shared among Top 2, Top 3, or Top 6 based on race format.
- **XP-Only Races:** Strategic races with no monetary reward, focused on progression.

This balanced distribution ensures that competition remains rewarding while continuously strengthening the ecosystem.
