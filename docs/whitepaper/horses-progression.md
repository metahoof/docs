✔ **Race Participation** → Finishing races grants **XP based on placement and competition difficulty**.  
✔ **Training & Strategy Development** → **Trainer NFTs** influence **fitness and XP gain**.  
✔ **Special Events & Tournaments** → **Exclusive races reward XP boosts** for high-ranked placements.

### XP Level Progression Table

Each class has **XP requirements** to level up, reflecting a horse’s **growth and competitive journey**.

| **Class**            | **Level Range** | **XP per Level** | **Total XP to Max Level** |
|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| **E (Novice)**       | 1-5             | **1,000 XP**     | **5,000 XP**              |
| **D (Beginner)**     | 6-10            | **2,500 XP**     | **12,500 XP**             |

**Advancing to the next class requires reaching max XP**, ensuring that **horses naturally progress into more
competitive tiers**.


## 3️⃣ Horse Decay System: Managing Performance Over Time

To maintain **realism and strategic depth**, MetaHoof introduces a **horse decay system**, which simulates the **aging
and performance variations** of racehorses.

✔ **Performance Decay** → Over time, horses may experience **slight reductions** in **stamina, acceleration, or peak
speed**.  
✔ **XP Retention** → XP earned **remains intact**, but **older horses require strategic fitness management**.  
✔ **Training & Recovery** → **Trainers & Fitness Contracts** **slow down decay**, ensuring longevity in competition.

Horses can **remain competitive for extended periods**, but players must **adapt training strategies** to **maximize
performance over time**.


## 4️⃣ Key Takeaways

- **Every horse in MetaHoof is unique**, with a **genetic blueprint and competitive potential**.  
- **The class system ensures fair matchmaking**, allowing horses to **progress through XP leveling**.  
- **Breeding strategy influences future generations**, shaping the **next line of champions**.  
- **Performance decay adds realism**, requiring players to **train, adapt, and refine strategies**.
