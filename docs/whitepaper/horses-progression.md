> Horse Progression: From Rookie to Racing Legend

In **MetaHoof**, horse progression isn’t just a stat grind — it’s a **strategic evolution**. From a raw, untrained foal to a legendary racehorse, each step of the journey is shaped by **skillful decisions, consistent performance, and smart management**.

Every horse, regardless of rarity or bloodline, has a **clear path to growth** through:

- 🏁 **Race performance**
- 🧠 **Training sessions**
- 🧬 **Genetic potential**
- 🕰️ **Longevity and decay management**

This progression system rewards **dedicated players**, supports **fair matchmaking**, and encourages **long-term planning**. From rising through the **Class Tiers** to mastering **XP development and aging dynamics**, players are immersed in a living, evolving competitive ecosystem.

Whether you're here to build a **dynasty of champions** or optimize every race day decision, mastering progression is **essential to success** in the MetaHoof universe.

## 1️⃣ Class System: Competitive Ranking & Race Tiers

Horses progress through **five competitive classes**, from **novice to elite**, based on **race performance and XP
growth**.

| **Class**                     | **Ranking**                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟤 **Class E (Novice)**       | **Entry-level class**, suited for newcomers learning game mechanics.          |
| 🟠 **Class D (Beginner)**     | Developing horses gaining experience and racing skills.                       |
| 🟡 **Class C (Intermediate)** | Competitive mid-tier horses with growing attributes.                          |
| 🔵 **Class B (Advanced)**     | Strong competitors with refined race strategies.                              |
| 🟣 **Class A (Expert)**       | **Top-tier horses**, built for **high-stakes racing and prestigious events**. |

Horses **compete within their class**, ensuring **fair competition**. **Advancing to a higher class** requires gaining
**XP through races**.

## 2️⃣ XP Level Progression: Training & Race Development

Horses in MetaHoof **earn XP (Experience Points)** through:  
✔ **Race Participation** → Finishing races grants **XP based on placement and competition difficulty**.  
✔ **Training & Strategy Development** → **Trainer NFTs** influence **fitness and XP gain**.  
✔ **Special Events & Tournaments** → **Exclusive races reward XP boosts** for high-ranked placements.

### XP Level Progression Table

Each class has **XP requirements** to level up, reflecting a horse’s **growth and competitive journey**.

| **Class**            | **Level Range** | **XP per Level** | **Total XP to Max Level** |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| **E (Novice)**       | 1-5             | **1,000 XP**     | **5,000 XP**              |
| **D (Beginner)**     | 6-10            | **2,500 XP**     | **12,500 XP**             |
| **C (Intermediate)** | 11-15           | **5,000 XP**     | **25,000 XP**             |
| **B (Advanced)**     | 16-20           | **10,000 XP**    | **50,000 XP**             |
| **A (Expert)**       | 21-25           | **20,000 XP**    | **100,000 XP**            |

**Advancing to the next class requires reaching max XP**, ensuring that **horses naturally progress into more
competitive tiers**.

## 3️⃣ Horse Decay System: Lifecycle & Durability Management

In MetaHoof, every horse goes through a realistic **career lifecycle** powered by our **Horse Decay System** — a core mechanic that introduces aging, performance management, and strategic depth to ownership.

### 🔄 Decay Levels: Structured Career Progression

Each horse has a **decay level** ranging from **0 to 6**, representing its career stage:

- **Decay Level 0**: Fresh and peak performance
- **Decay Level 6**: Veteran stage with slightly reduced capabilities

Decay is not abrupt — it occurs **progressively over races**, with each level reached after a defined number of races. This simulates wear, aging, and encourages lifecycle planning.

### 🧮 Race Thresholds: Races Until Next Decay

After each race, a horse reduces its “races until next decay” counter. When it reaches 0, the horse advances to the next decay level.

To reflect fair value and rarity strength, race durability is tied to both **rarity** and **generation**.

### 📊 Decay Threshold Table (Races Required per Level)

The table below shows how many races a horse can run at each decay level depending on its **rarity** and **generation**.

- **Total Career Durability** (sum of all levels):
  - G1 Legendary: 414 races
  - G2 Rare: 240 races
  - G4+ Common: 118 races

### 📘 How Decay Affects Performance

- **Soft Penalties**: Performance gradually declines across decay levels (e.g., -2% to -18%), without hard-stopping horses.
- **No Attribute Rewrite**: Base stats remain immutable. Decay is applied at runtime for fairness and blockchain compatibility.
- **Breeding Eligibility**: Horses can breed after reaching Decay Level 2. **G1s** are always breeding-eligible from the start.

### 🛠️ Extend Career with Strategy

- Apply **Recovery Items** to delay decay.
- Run **Training Sessions** instead test races to avoid fast decay.
- Use **G1s as legacy assets** with superior longevity and utility.

MetaHoof’s decay system rewards thoughtful play, long-term planning, and maintains the integrity of horse value across all generations.

## 4️⃣ Key Takeaways

- **Every horse in MetaHoof is unique**, with a **genetic blueprint and competitive potential**.
- **The class system ensures fair matchmaking**, allowing horses to **progress through XP leveling**.
- **Breeding strategy influences future generations**, shaping the **next line of champions**.
- **Performance decay adds realism**, requiring players to **train, adapt, and refine strategies**.
