> Horse Progression: From Rookie to Racing Legend

In **MetaHoof**, horse progression isn’t just a stat grind — it’s a **strategic evolution**. From a raw, untrained foal to a legendary racehorse, each step of the journey is shaped by **skillful decisions, consistent performance, and smart management**.

Every horse, regardless of rarity or bloodline, has a **clear path to growth** through:

- 🏁 **Race performance**
- 🧠 **Training sessions**
- 🧬 **Genetic potential**
- 🕰️ **Longevity and decay management**

This progression system rewards **dedicated players**, supports **fair matchmaking**, and encourages **long-term planning**. From rising through the **Class Tiers** to mastering **XP development and aging dynamics**, players are immersed in a living, evolving competitive ecosystem.

Whether you're here to build a **dynasty of champions** or optimize every race day decision, mastering progression is **essential to success** in the MetaHoof universe.

## 1️⃣ Class System: Competitive Ranking & Race Tiers

Horses progress through **five competitive classes**, from **novice to elite**, based on **race performance and XP
growth**.

| **Class**                     | **Ranking**                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🟤 **Class E (Novice)**       | **Entry-level class**, suited for newcomers learning game mechanics.          |
| 🟠 **Class D (Beginner)**     | Developing horses gaining experience and racing skills.                       |
| 🟡 **Class C (Intermediate)** | Competitive mid-tier horses with growing attributes.                          |
| 🔵 **Class B (Advanced)**     | Strong competitors with refined race strategies.                              |
| 🟣 **Class A (Expert)**       | **Top-tier horses**, built for **high-stakes racing and prestigious events**. |

Horses **compete within their class**, ensuring **fair competition**. **Advancing to a higher class** requires gaining
**XP through races**.

## 2️⃣ XP Level Progression: Training & Race Development

Horses in MetaHoof **earn XP (Experience Points)** through:  
✔ **Race Participation** → Finishing races grants **XP based on placement and competition difficulty**.  
✔ **Training & Strategy Development** → **Trainer NFTs** influence **fitness and XP gain**.  
✔ **Special Events & Tournaments** → **Exclusive races reward XP boosts** for high-ranked placements.

### XP Level Progression Table

Each class has **XP requirements** to level up, reflecting a horse’s **growth and competitive journey**.

| **Class**            | **Level Range** | **XP per Level** | **Total XP to Max Class Level** |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **E (Novice)**       | 1-5             | **1,000 XP**     | **5,000 XP**                    |
| **D (Beginner)**     | 6-10            | **2,500 XP**     | **12,500 XP**                   |
| **C (Intermediate)** | 11-15           | **5,000 XP**     | **25,000 XP**                   |
| **B (Advanced)**     | 16-20           | **10,000 XP**    | **50,000 XP**                   |
| **A (Expert)**       | 21-25           | **20,000 XP**    | **100,000 XP**                  |

**Advancing to the next class requires reaching max XP**, ensuring that **horses naturally progress into more
competitive tiers**.

## 3️⃣ Horse Aging System: Natural Growth & Career Evolution

In MetaHoof, every horse experiences a **career shaped by natural aging**, reflecting realistic growth, peak performance, and the eventual challenges of time. This **Horse Aging System** introduces a dynamic progression curve where attributes shift as horses mature through different life stages.

### 🔄 Life Stages: From Foal to Old Guard

Each horse advances through **eight defined stages** over the course of its racing career. Attributes are subtly adjusted to reflect the balance between physical growth, peak condition, and veteran experience.

| **Age Stage**   | **Description**                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Foal**        | Raw potential, just beginning the journey.         |
| **Juvenile**    | Developing strength and racing awareness.          |
| **Young Adult** | Balanced attributes, ready for competition.        |
| **Prime Early** | Strong gains in performance and consistency.       |
| **Peak**        | The height of ability, delivering top performance. |
| **Mature**      | Retains strength with strategic endurance focus.   |
| **Veteran**     | Seasoned competitor with stable temperament.       |
| **Old Guard**   | Legacy stage, competing with wisdom and grit.      |

### 🧮 Progression Through Racing

Horses naturally progress through these stages as they complete races. The transition between stages reflects accumulated racing experience and careful management rather than abrupt changes.


Progression ensures that no stage is without value:

- Early stages build foundation and potential.
- Peak stages maximize competitive strength.
- Later stages emphasize resilience, temperament, and experience.

> **Breeding Restriction:** Horses in the **Foal** and **Juvenile** stages cannot breed.  
Breeding eligibility begins at the **Young Adult** stage and continues through later stages, ensuring that horses mature before contributing to bloodlines.

### 📊 Attribute Evolution

Each stage subtly adjusts a horse’s performance factors, creating a living curve of growth, peak, and graceful decline. This ensures that horses remain competitive while rewarding **strategic training and long-term planning**.

### 📊 Age Progression Table (Races Required per Stage)

The table below defines how many races a horse can complete before naturally progressing to the next **Age Stage**.  
All generations share the **same lifecycle length**, ensuring fair competition and accessibility for new players.  
Prestige for earlier generations (such as G1) is reflected through **enhanced breeding potential**, exclusive events, and leaderboard opportunities — not reduced lifespans.

| **Age Stage**   | **Description**     | **All Generations (per Rarity)**                           |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Peak**        | Top performance     | 22 races (Common) / 36 races (Rare) / 54 races (Legendary) |
| **Mature**      | Endurance advantage | 18 races (Common) / 30 races (Rare) / 48 races (Legendary) |
| **Veteran**     | Stable temperament  | 15 races (Common) / 25 races (Rare) / 40 races (Legendary) |
| **Old Guard**   | Legacy and wisdom   | 12 races (Common) / 20 races (Rare) / 32 races (Legendary) |

#### 📌 Total Career Races (Estimated)

- **Legendary**: ~486 races
- **Rare**: ~333 races
