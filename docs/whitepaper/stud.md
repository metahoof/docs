> Optimizing Breeding with Strategic Stallion Selection

## 1️⃣ What Are Stud Offers?

Stud offers play a **crucial role** in the MetaHoof breeding system, allowing players to **utilize high-quality
stallions** to enhance the genetic traits of their offspring. Instead of owning both parents, players can **pay a stud
fee** to breed with another player’s stallion, making it possible to refine bloodlines, improve race potential, and
strategically manage breeding investments.

This mechanic ensures a **dynamic, player-driven breeding economy**, where stallion owners can **profit from their elite
bloodlines**, and breeders can **access superior genetics without purchasing top-tier stallions outright**.

## 2️⃣ Stud Fees & Minimum Pricing Models

Stud fees are the **costs associated with breeding** using a stallion. The **base minimum fee** is set to **prevent market devaluation**, maintain a **healthy breeding economy**, and ensure stallion owners **receive fair compensation**.

### 🔹 Base Minimum Value & Pricing by Stallion Class

retain exclusivity** while allowing **entry-level players to participate** in the breeding market.
