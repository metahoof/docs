## 1️⃣ Overview

Strategies are a core gameplay system in **MetaHoof** that allow players to define how their horse behaves during a race. Before each race, players must select a **Racing Strategy**, which guides how the horse distributes its effort, when to push harder, and how to react to different phases of the race.

A well-chosen strategy can be the difference between victory and fading out before the finish. Strategies also play a role during **training sessions**, helping players build race-ready horses by simulating real scenarios.

## 2️⃣ How Strategies Work

A racing strategy is composed of **three key elements**:

### 🏃‍♂️ Race Pacing

Defines how your horse distributes energy across the race.

| Value | Style         | Description                                                                 |
|-------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | **High Effort** | Pushes hard early. Can gain early lead but risks stamina depletion.         |
| 5     | **Balanced**   | Even energy usage across all race phases. Reliable and consistent.          |
| 10    | **Energy Saver** | Conserves energy early to maximize power in final stages.                 |

**Gameplay Effect:**  
- Directly affects stamina drain rate over time.
- Impacts how long your horse can sustain top performance without burning out.


### ⚡ Sprint Trigger

Determines when your horse initiates its peak performance burst during the race.

| Value | Trigger Timing | Description                                                                 |
|-------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | **Early Burst** | Attempts a strong push early, risking stamina loss if mistimed.            |
| 5     | **Mid Race Push** | A balanced surge during the race's middle portion.                         |
| 10    | **Final Sprint** | Reserved for the last stretch—requires stamina and precision.              |

**Gameplay Effect:**  
- Triggers a short-lived but powerful speed burst.
- Poor timing or low stamina can reduce its effectiveness or cause penalties.


### 🎯 Race Style

Controls how cautiously or aggressively your horse behaves under pressure.

| Value | Style         | Description                                                                 |
|-------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | **Safe**       | Low-risk approach. Rarely makes mistakes but can lack edge in tight races. |
| 5     | **Moderate**   | Balanced tactical awareness. Adapts based on position and pacing.          |
| 10    | **Aggressive** | High-risk, high-reward. Can cause penalties like bad starts or transitions.|

**Gameplay Effect:**  
- Aggressive styles may trigger behavior penalties under poor temperament.
- Horses with high temperament perform better under high-pressure tactics.

## 3️⃣ Using Strategies in Training

Training sessions allow players to:

- Experiment with strategies.
- Analyze performance based on pacing and sprint triggers.
- Build familiarity between horse and strategy type.

## 4️⃣ Strategy & Horse Synergy

Every horse has different traits (stamina, temperament, agility). These affect how well they respond to strategies:

- **High temperament** → struggles with aggressive styles.
- **High stamina** → ideal for early sprints or sustained pace.

Combining strategy + horse traits + trainer synergy is key for peak performance.

## 🎮 Strategy Creation Interface

Creating a strategy in **MetaHoof** is intuitive and visual. The interface uses **sliders** to define your horse’s behavioral profile across three key attributes:

### 🎛️ Slider System: 1 to 10 Scale

Each attribute is adjustable on a **1–10 scale**, allowing players to fine-tune their approach for different horses and race types.

| Attribute          | Description                                               | Scale Range                                      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Race Pacing**    | Controls how your horse distributes effort over the race. | 1 = High Effort (fast start) ↔ 10 = Energy Saver |
| **Sprint Trigger** | Sets when the horse initiates its peak burst of speed.    | 1 = Early Burst ↔ 10 = Final Sprint              |
| **Race Style**     | Defines the horse's behavioral risk under pressure.       | 1 = Safe ↔ 10 = Aggressive                       |

### 🧠 Strategy Insights Panel

As you adjust the sliders, the system provides **real-time insights** on the right-hand panel:

- **Race Pacing**: Shows the selected pacing style (e.g., Balanced Pace).
- **Sprint Trigger**: Reflects the chosen moment to trigger sprint (e.g., Mid Race Focus).
- **Race Style**: Indicates how risky or safe the strategy is.
- **Strategy Analysis**: A smart summary of your overall setup — whether it's balanced, high-risk, or energy-conservative.

### ✅ Finalizing Your Strategy

Once satisfied with your configuration:

1. Give your strategy a **unique name**.
2. Click **Create Strategy** to save it for use in races and training sessions.

Your horse will follow this strategy whenever it's assigned—so pick wisely and always test it under different conditions.
