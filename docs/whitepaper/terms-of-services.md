# **MetaHoof Terms of Service**

_Draft Outline_

## **1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms**

Welcome to MetaHoof, a digital horse racing game platform developed and operated by ANP Labs, a company legally established in Brazil. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the MetaHoof platform, including our website, game, services, features, content, and associated technologies (collectively, the “Platform”). By using or accessing MetaHoof, you agree to be bound by these Terms, which form a binding legal agreement between you and ANP Labs.

If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use or access MetaHoof in any form.

MetaHoof is a digital horse racing game. It includes a website, game client, services, features, content, and supporting technologies. Users may interact with MetaHoof using supported sign‑in methods and payment providers. Where MetaHoof integrates third‑party services (such as identity, payments, age‑verification, or storefronts), the terms and policies of those third parties apply to that portion of your experience and are incorporated by reference to the extent required by those providers.

_Important Notice:_

_MetaHoof is intended exclusively for users who are 18 years or older, or who meet the minimum legal age in their jurisdiction for accessing digital games and online services. If it is unlawful or restricted in your region to access online games or virtual items, you are prohibited from using MetaHoof._

ANP Labs reserves the right to amend or update these Terms at any time. All changes will be posted on the Platform, and your continued use of MetaHoof constitutes your acceptance of any such updates. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically for modifications.

- Delegation of responsibilities to third-party service providers or operators acting on behalf of ANP Labs

Such assignment shall not impair your rights under these Terms but may affect the entity delivering services.

_By continuing to use MetaHoof, you acknowledge and agree that ANP Labs may transfer its rights and obligations at any time as part of its business operations._

## **22. Severability**

If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law or by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be severed and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect.

- The invalid or unenforceable portion shall be interpreted, where possible, in a manner that most closely reflects the original intent of the parties.
- The failure of ANP Labs to enforce any provision or right under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that provision or right.

_These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and ANP Labs with respect to your use of MetaHoof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and understandings, whether oral or written._
