## **5. Scope of Service**

MetaHoof is a blockchain-integrated digital horse racing game developed by ANP Labs. It provides users with an interactive, strategic gameplay experience where digital assets (NFTs) such as racehorses, trainers, and in-game items can be collected, used, and traded through Ultra’s blockchain infrastructure.

### **5.1. Description of MetaHoof and Its Features**

MetaHoof offers a range of features designed to enhance competitive gameplay and digital ownership:

- **Race Simulation:** Horses participate in deterministic, strategy-based races that factor in traits, energy, conditions, and user-selected strategies.
- **NFT Ownership:** Users own in-game items (e.g., horses, trainers) via Ultra NFTs, which are tokenized assets stored and verifiable on the Ultra blockchain.
- **Season Passes & Leaderboards:** Players can earn points and rewards via events, competitions, and limited-time campaigns.
- **Breeding & Asset Progression:** Certain NFTs (like horses) can evolve or breed, generating new assets with varying rarity and traits.
- **Gameplay Economy:** Entry fees, rewards, breeding costs, and other economic interactions are conducted in blockchain tokens (primarily $UOS).

> _MetaHoof is **not a gambling platform**. Race outcomes are the result of user strategies and simulation logic, with no betting or random financial rewards._

### **5.2. Platforms and Access Channels**

MetaHoof is accessible through:

- **Web Browsers:** The primary interface for gameplay, wallet connection, and marketplace interactions.
- **Ultra Wallet:** Required to access blockchain features and interact with owned assets. MetaHoof does not issue or manage its own wallet infrastructure.
- **Ultra Platform Integration:** All identity, wallet management, and asset transfers are performed through Ultra’s SDK, protocols, and APIs.

## **7. Tokens and Virtual Currency**

MetaHoof utilizes blockchain-based virtual currencies and NFTs to facilitate gameplay mechanics, access to features, and participation in economic systems. However, MetaHoof does not issue or control its own token and does not conduct any form of token sale, ICO, or TGE.

All in-game economic interactions occur through Ultra’s native token ($UOS) and assets governed by Ultra’s NFT Protocol.

> _MetaHoof is **not an investment platform**. All virtual items and token usage are intended solely for **gameplay and entertainment purposes**._

## **8. Purchase, Sale, and Transfer of Digital Items (NFTs)**

MetaHoof integrates NFT-based digital items (such as racehorses, trainers, breeding licenses, and energy refills) using Ultra’s NFT protocol. These assets are owned and controlled by users through their Ultra Wallets and can be traded or transferred in accordance with Ultra’s smart contract rules.

- You do **not** receive:
  - Commercial rights to the art or content;
  - IP ownership of MetaHoof designs or data;
  - Rights to duplicate, alter, or re-sell the art beyond allowed secondary trading.
- Any attempt to misrepresent ownership, modify the NFTs, or use them in unauthorized commercial contexts constitutes a violation of these Terms and may lead to enforcement actions.

### **8.4. Disclaimer of Market Value Guarantees**

- MetaHoof makes no representations or warranties regarding the market value, liquidity, or appreciation of any NFT or digital item.
- Asset pricing is determined by market dynamics, and NFTs may lose their entire value at any time.

## **21. Assignment**

### **21.1. User’s Prohibition on Assigning Rights**

You may not assign, transfer, delegate, or sublicense any of your rights or obligations under these Terms — whether by operation of law or otherwise — without the prior written consent of ANP Labs. Any attempted assignment in violation of this section shall be null, void, and without effect.

- The invalid or unenforceable portion shall be interpreted, where possible, in a manner that most closely reflects the original intent of the parties.
- The failure of ANP Labs to enforce any provision or right under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that provision or right.

_These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and ANP Labs with respect to your use of MetaHoof and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and understandings, whether oral or written._
