# 🏇 How to Find the Best Horse for a Race in MetaHoof

## 🔍 Analyze Your Horse’s Attributes

Every MetaHoof horse is defined by four primary performance stats:

- **Speed** 🚀 – How fast the horse can go at top pace.
- **Endurance** 🛡 – How long it can maintain high speeds before tiring.
- **Agility** 🎯 – How quickly it adapts to pace changes and turns.
- **Temperament** 🧠 – Mental toughness; impacts focus, pacing discipline, and ability to follow strategy under pressure.

These stats aren't isolated—they work together based on the **type of race** you’re entering.

## 🏁 Match Attributes with Race Distance

Race distances are categorized as:

- **Short (e.g., 1000m)** – Prioritize **Speed** and **Agility**.
- **Mid (e.g., 1600m)** – Look for balanced horses with solid **Endurance** and **Speed**.
- **Long (e.g., 2200m+)** – Strong **Endurance** and **Temperament** are critical here.

👉 *A high-speed horse may lead early but burn out in long races. Don’t just chase stars—match them to the course.*

## 🧬 Consider Bloodline Characteristics

Each bloodline comes with innate strengths and weaknesses. For example:

- Some may lean toward **sprinter traits** (high Speed/Agility).
- Others favor **long-distance endurance** or **stable Temperament**.

### 🌦 Bloodlines & Weather

Bloodline influences how your horse handles race-day conditions:

- **Sunny:** Most bloodlines perform neutrally.
- **Rainy or Cloudy:** Some horses gain hidden bonuses—or penalties—based on heritage.

Choose a horse whose **bloodline thrives in that day's weather**.

---

## 🛤 Track Surface Compatibility

Tracks come in three types:

- **Grass**
- **Dirt**
- **Synthetic**

Your horse's **bloodline** and **training history** affect performance on each surface. Some bloodlines run better on grass, while others dominate dirt. Always **check the race surface** and pick a horse familiar with it.

---

## 🎯 Strategy Sync: Stats + Mindset

Before the race, you’ll assign your horse a **Strategy**, such as:

- Aggressive front-runner
- Balanced pace
- Late sprinter

Your chosen strategy must align with:

- **Attributes:** A late sprinter needs high **Endurance** and **Agility**.
- **Temperament:** Horses with low Temperament might abandon your plan mid-race!

⚠️ *Misaligned strategy can ruin even the strongest horse’s chances. A high-stat horse won’t perform well if it can’t stick to the plan.*

---

## 🧠 Don’t Ignore Fitness & Training

Fitness directly affects performance. A horse with low Fitness will:

- Tire faster
- React slower to strategy changes
- Underperform even with great stats

Keep your horse **active and well-trained** between races. Regular training boosts Fitness and keeps Energy levels optimal for race day.

## ✅ Final Checklist Before Entering a Race

1. **Check the distance** – Short, Mid, or Long?
2. **Review weather and surface** – Match with bloodline strengths.
3. **Analyze horse stats** – Speed, Endurance, Agility, Temperament.
4. **Pick a fitting strategy** – Align it with your horse’s personality.
5. **Inspect Energy and Fitness** – Rested, trained horses perform better.
6. **Compare competition** – Choose races where your horse has an edge.
