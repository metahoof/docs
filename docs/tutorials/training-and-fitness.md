# 🏋️ Training & Fitness

Training is essential to prepare your horses for top performance on the track. It not only simulates a horse's race-day behavior but also plays a crucial role in its development and fitness.

## 🎯 Why Training Matters

Each training session helps your horse in three important ways:

- **Behavior Simulation**: Training sessions mimic race scenarios, allowing you to understand how your horse behaves and strategize accordingly.
- **XP Gain**: Horses gain experience points (XP) after each session, which helps them progress and unlock new levels.
- **Fitness Boost**: Training improves your horse’s **Fitness Level**, a key factor for racing at its best. A fully fit horse performs better and has more consistency during races.

## 🧑‍🏫 Training Requirements

To train a horse, you'll need:

- A **Trainer** assigned to your horse.
- A **Trainer Contract**, which is consumed with each training session.

Make sure you have contracts available and the right trainer to optimize your horse’s growth.

## 📍 Managing Training

All your training activity can be managed through the **Trainer Center**. There, you can:

- View recent training sessions
- Track XP progress and fitness levels
- Assign or change trainers

Regular training keeps your horse in shape and ready to race at its full potential. Stay consistent and strategic to build a champion!
