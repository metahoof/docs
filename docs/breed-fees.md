> **Ensuring Sustainable Horse Breeding Through a Dynamic Fee Structure**

Breeding in **MetaHoof** is not just about combining two horses‚Äîit‚Äôs a **strategic investment**. To maintain **economic balance, genetic rarity, and competitive value**, breeding requires a **Breeding Fee** that varies based on key factors:

‚úî **Breed Type** ‚Üí The genetic complexity of the pairing.  
‚úî **Generation** ‚Üí The rarity and lineage of the offspring.  
‚úî **Class** ‚Üí The competitive tier of the horses involved.

Breeding Fees act as **a natural supply regulator**, ensuring that higher-quality and rarer offspring **carry a proportional cost** while incentivizing **calculated breeding decisions**.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Base Breeding Fees by Generation**

Each generation has a **different base breeding cost**, ensuring that earlier generations remain valuable while allowing controlled expansion of new bloodlines.

| **Generation**              | **Base Breeding Fee (USD)** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **G1 (Genesis) Mint Price** | **$20** (fixed)             |

| **G3**                      | **$25**                     |
| **G4+**                     | **$22**                     |

üìå **Key Takeaways:**
- **G2 breeding costs more than minting G1**, preventing early mass breeding.
- **Later generations have slightly lower fees**, making breeding more accessible over time.
- **This ensures a healthy economy while maintaining rarity.**

| **Purebred** | **1.2x** | Strong bloodline, predictable traits. |
| **Crossbreed** | **1.0x** | Balanced, mid-tier breeding. |
| **Legendary Breed** | **1.5x** | Rare genetics, superior inheritance. |

üìå **Key Impact:**
- **Purebreds pay more** to reflect their **elite, specialized traits**.
- **Crossbreeds have a neutral fee**, offering a flexible mid-tier option.
- **Legendary Breeds demand a premium**, ensuring **rarity and competitive value**.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Class-Based Fee Multipliers**

The **class of the parent horses** affects the **potential racing ability** of the offspring. Fees increase for **higher-class pairings**.

| **Horse Class** | **Multiplier** | **Reasoning** |
|--------------|------------|----------------------------------|
| **Class A** | **2.0x** | Elite racers, high demand. |
| **Class B** | **1.5x** | Competitive, valuable foals. |
| **Class C** | **1.2x** | Mid-range, adaptable. |
| **Class D** | **1.1x** | Entry-level horses. |
| **Class E** | **1.0x** | Most affordable, common horses. |

üìå **Key Impact:**

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Final Breeding Fee Formula**

### **Total Breeding Fee = Base Fee √ó Breed Type Multiplier √ó Class Modifier**

üìå **Example Calculations:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Breeding a Purebred G2 Class A Horse**
- **Base Cost: $30**
- **Purebred Modifier: 1.2x**
- **Class A Modifier: 2.0x**
- **Final Cost: $30 √ó 1.2 √ó 2.0 = $72**

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Breeding a Crossbreed G3 Class C Horse**
- **Base Cost: $25**
- **Crossbreed Modifier: 1.0x**
- **Class C Modifier: 1.2x**
- **Final Cost: $25 √ó 1.0 √ó 1.2 = $30**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Breeding a Legendary G2 Class B Horse**
- **Base Cost: $30**
- **Legendary Modifier: 1.5x**
- **Class B Modifier: 1.5x**
- **Final Cost: $30 √ó 1.5 √ó 1.5 = $67.50**
